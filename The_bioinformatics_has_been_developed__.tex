The bioinformatics has been developed rapidly in the last decade or so. The traditional protein research involve strenuous experimental procedures and proform on individual protein at one time. Consequently, early study on protease are commonly limited to small number of underline substrates . The appearance of recombinant library has expanded our understanding to exo-hydrolytic event greatly by using large recombinant terminal libraries.

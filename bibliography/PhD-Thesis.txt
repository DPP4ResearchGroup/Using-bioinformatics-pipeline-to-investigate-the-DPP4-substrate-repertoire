The enzyme was estimated to be Mr 190,000 by HPLC gel filtration and Mr 90,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis. The enzyme showed general properties reported for detergent-solubilized DPP IV from other tissues. It was Con A binding and almost completely inhibited by 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate and Diprotin A. The pI was 5.6 and the pH optimum was 7.5. The specific activity for Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide was 31.9 units/mg. HPLC analysis demonstrated the release of dipeptides of the N-terminal of substance P, beta-casomorphin, and their related peptides. A stoichiometric reaction of the enzyme on substance P was observed. The epidermal DPP IV had a Km of 0.3 mM and a kcat of 50.3 s-1 for substance P and the Km value decreased by shortening the peptide from the carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The enzyme hydrolyzed human and bovine beta-casomorphin with Km values of 0.025 and 0.05 mM, respectively. Shortening the bovine beta-casomorphin peptide chain did not affect enzyme affinity.},

This generates several mature peptides with N-terminal X-Pro-sequences. However, in certain non-mammalian tissues repetitive pre-sequences of this type are removed by specialized dipeptidyl (amino)peptidases during maturation. In mammals, proline-specific proteases are not involved in the biosynthesis of regulatory peptides, but due to their unique specificity they could play an important role in the degradation of them. Evidence exists that dipeptidyl (amino)peptidase IV at the cell surface of endothelial cells sequesters circulating peptide hormones which are then susceptible to broader aminopeptidase attack. The cleavage of several neuropeptides by prolyl endopeptidase has been demonstrated in vitro, but its role in the brain is questionable since the precise localization of the protease is not clarified.},

  pages = {1-14},
  abstract = {This review focusses on the behavioural effects of histamine and drugs which affect histaminergic function, particularly the H1- and H2-receptors antagonists. Research in this area has assumed considerable importance with increasing interest in the role of brain histamine, the clinical use of both H1 and H2 antagonists and evidence of nonmedical use of H1 antagonists. Results from a number of studies show that H1 and H2 antagonists have clear, but distinct subjective effects and that H1 antagonists have discriminative effects in animals. While H1 antagonists are reinforcers in certain conditions, histamine itself is a punisher. Moderate doses of H1 antagonists affect psychomotor performance in some situations, but the results are variable. The exceptions are terfenadine and astemizole, which do not seem to penetrate the blood-brain barrier readily. In studies of schedule-controlled behaviour, marked changes in response rate have been observed following administration of H1 antagonists, with the magnitude and direction dependent on the dose and the baseline behaviour. Histamine reduces avoidance responding, an effect mediated via H1-receptors. Changes in drinking and aggressive behaviour have also been observed following histamine administration and distinct roles for H1- and H2-receptors have been delineated. Separate H1- and H2-receptor mechanisms have also been suggested to account for changes in activity level. While the H2 antagonists do not always have strong behavioural effects when administered peripherally, there is evidence that cimetidine has a depressant effect on sexual function. These and other findings reveal an important role for histaminergic systems in a wide range of behaviour.},

  abstract = {The plasma enzyme responsible for primary proteolytic cleavage of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH) at the 2-3 amino acid bond was characterized. Native GRH[GRH(1-44)-NH2 and GRH(1-40)-OH], and COOH-terminally shortened fragments [GRH(1-32)-NH2 and GRH(1-29)-NH2] were rapidly cleaved, while GRH(2-32)-NH2 was not degraded at this site. Moreover, degradation to GRH(3-44)-NH2 was unaffected by an aminopeptidase inhibitor, indicating that this metabolite was generated from a single step cleavage by a dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP) rather than sequential aminopeptidase cleavages. Conversion to GRH(3-44)-NH2 was blocked by diprotin A, a DPP type IV (DPP IV) competitive inhibitor. D-Amino acid substitution at either position 1 or 2 also prevented hydrolysis, characteristic of DPP IV. Analysis of endogenous plasma GRH immunoreactivity from a human GRH transgenic pig revealed that the major peak coeluted with GRH(3-44)-NH2. Native GRH exhibited trypsin-like degradation at the 11-12 position but cleavage at the 12-13 site occurred only with GRH(1-32)-NH2 and GRH(1-29)-NH2. Formation of these metabolites was independent of prior DPP IV hydrolysis but was greatly reduced by trypsin inhibitors. Evaluation of plasma stability of potential GRH super analogues, designed to resist degradation by these enzymes, confirmed that GRH degradation in plasma occurs primarily by DPP IV, and to a lesser extent by trypsin-like enzyme(s).},

Kinetic constants were determined for the degradation of a number of other natural peptides, including substance P, the degradation of which has been described earlier in a qualitative manner. Generally, small peptides are degraded much more rapidly than proteins. However, the Km-values seem to be independent of the peptide chain length.

  abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that Fischer-344 rats from Japanese Charles River Inc. specifically lack dipeptidyl(amino)peptidase IV (DAP IV-negative; EC 3.4.14.5), whereas Fischer-344 rats from sources within the United States (DAP IV-positive) possess normal DAP IV activity. In the present study, plasma from DAP IV-positive rats metabolized substance P (SP) (5.37 +/- 0.25 nmol/min/ml) via the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) (1.86 +/- 0.50 nmol/min/ml) and DAP IV (2.56 +/- 0.42 nmol/min/ml). DAP IV sequentially converted SP to SP[3-11] and SP[5-11]. The SP[5-11] metabolite was then rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma aminopeptidase M (AmM; EC 3.4.11.2) (36.2 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/ml). In contrast, SP metabolism by plasma from DAP IV-negative rats was less than half that of control animals (2.14 +/- 0.06 nmol/min/ml), due to a complete lack of DAP IV hydrolysis. The absence of DAP IV was not associated with any differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of SP (1.45 +/- 0.11 nmol/min/ml) or AmM-mediated hydrolysis of SP[5-11] (37.1 +/- 0.9 nmol/min/ml). Consistent with this deficiency in SP metabolism, SP was more potent in vivo in stimulating salivary secretion in DAP IV-negative rats compared to DAP IV-positive animals. Potentiation was specific in that SP[5-11], an SP fragment resistant to DAP IV, was equipotent in DAP IV-negative and positive animals. SP[5-11]-induced salivary secretion was potentiated in both strains when AmM-mediated hydrolysis was inhibited by amastatin (20 nmol/min, i.v.). These data provide direct evidence for a significant role for DAP IV and AmM in the in vivo processing of SP and active SP metabolites.},

  abstract = {The kinetics and selectivity of proteolysis of synthetic human growth hormone-releasing factor and analogs by purified human placental dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were studied by HPLC. The initial rates of Ala2-Asp3 cleavage (pH 7.8, 37 degrees C, So = 0.15 mM) were all approx. 5 mumol min-1 mg-1 for the parent hormone, GRF(1-44)-NH2, and the fragments, GRF(1-29)-NH2 and GRF(1-20)-NH2. Lower activities observed for GRF(1-11)-OH, GRF(1-3)-OH, and cyclic lactam analogs indicate S1'-Sn' binding. Assays of [Trp6]-GRF(1-29)-NH2 versus [D-Trp6]-GFR(1-29)-NH2 indicate an S4' binding cavity. Peptides with D-configuration at P2, P1 or P1' and desNH2Tyr1 and N-MeTyr1 analogs of GRF were not cleaved. Catalytic parameters for the P1-substituted analogs [X2,Ala15]-GRF(1-29)-NH2 were found to vary with X as follows, Km: Abu less than Ala less than Pro less than Val less than Ser less than Gly much less than Leu; kcat: Pro greater than Ala greater than Abu greater than Ser greater than Gly much greater than Leu greater than Val; kcat/Km: Abu greater than Pro greater than Ala much greater than Ser greater than Gly = Val much greater than Leu. Km is at a minimum and kcat/Km at a maximum, for a hydrophobic P1 side-chain of about 0.25 nm in length, i.e., the ethyl side-chain of alpha-aminobutyric acid (Abu) is very close to optimal. These results further define the S1 selectivity of DPP IV and may be useful in the design of DPP IV resistant GRF analogs that can be produced by recombinant DNA methods and the design of DPP IV inhibitors.},

This study investigated rat GRF(1-29)NH2 processing in serum and liver homogenate by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Synthetic rGRF(1-29)NH2 (30 microM) was incubated (0-120 min, 37 degrees C) in serum (49 +/- 8 mg prot./ml). The rGRF(1-29)NH2 (10 microM) was also incubated (0-120 min, 37 degrees C) with liver homogenate (200 +/- 6 micrograms prot./ml). Time course studies of rGRF(1-29)NH2 disappearance showed apparent half-lives of 18 +/- 4 min and 13 +/- 3 min in serum and liver homogenate, respectively. This was accompanied by the appearance of degradation products that were all less hydrophobic than the native peptide. In the serum, two major metabolites were detected and isolated by preparative HPLC. Combined results of amino acid analysis, sequencing, and chromatography with synthetic homologs revealed the presence of rGRF(1-20)OH and (3-20)OH. A small amount of rGRF(12-29)NH2, coeluting with rGRF(3-20)OH, was also found by sequencing. In the liver, rGRF(1-18)OH, (3-18)OH, and (1-10)OH were identified. The peptide bond Ala2-Asp3 (DPP IV cleavage site) was hydrolyzed in both serum and liver. Other tissue-specific cleavage sites were Arg11-Arg12 and Arg20-Lys21 (trypsin-like cleavage site) in the serum, and Tyr10-Arg11 and Tyr18-Ala19 (chymotrypsin-like cleavage site) in the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The contribution made by different enzymes to the degradation of bradykinin in physiological conditions was estimated by examining bradykinin metabolism in rat serum, in the in situ perfused lung and in vivo. METHODS: Dose-response curves for the hypotensive effect of intra-arterially and intravenously injected bradykinin were obtained in unanaesthetized rats. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the products of bradykinin breakdown after incubation with rat serum and perfusion through in situ lung preparations. RESULTS: In rat serum, kininase I degraded 34% and kininase II 11% of bradykinin, no evidence for other activities being detected. In the awake rat, D,L-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropionic acid, an inhibitor of kininase I, did not reduce the percentage of bradykinin inactivation in the pulmonary circulation. In the in situ perfused lung 65% of bradykinin was metabolized and the main products were BK1-7, BK1-5 and BK4-9. Enalaprilat (an inhibitor of kininase II) blocked the formation of BK1-7 and BK1-5 and increased the recovery of BK4-9. beta-Mercapto-ethanol, which inhibits aminopeptidase P, and diprotin A, a specific inhibitor of dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV, both reduced the formation of BK4-9. Diprotin A also allowed the recovery of BK2-9. Bradykinin degradation and BK4-9 recovery were not affected by endopeptidase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the main degradation pathway of bradykinin in the lung is through the action of kininase II at the carboxyl terminus, and sequential cleavage by aminopeptidase P followed by dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV at the amino terminus. The amino-terminal degradation of bradykinin represents about 38% of the total lung kininase activity.},

  abstract = {Two receptor subtypes, Y1 and Y2, are known to mediate PYY biological activity. PYY 1-36 binds to Y1 and Y2 receptors with equal affinity, whereas the second endogenous form of PYY, PYY 3-36, selectively binds to Y2 receptors. Dipeptidyl cleavage thus transforms an unselective Y agonist into a highly selective Y2 agonist, PYY 3-36. The enzyme responsible for this processing is unknown. Since PYY has a proline in the penultimate position it is protected from the attack of most unspecific exopeptidases. Only a few exopeptidases are theoretically capable of generating PYY 3-36 from PYY 1-36. Of the enzymes tested only the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPP IV, E.C. 3.4.14.5) cleaved Tyr-Pro from PYY 1-36 with high activity. Since DPP IV is found on the endothelial surface and brush border membranes it can be considered a candidate enzyme for generating PYY 3-36 in vivo, thereby regulating the ratio of Y1/Y2 receptor stimulation by PYY.},

  abstract = {Neuropeptide Y, peptide YY and pancreatic polypeptide share an evolutionary conserved proline-rich N-terminal sequence, a structure generally known to be inert to the attack of common proteinases, but a potential target for specialized proline-specific aminopeptidases. Purified human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (also termed CD 26) liberated N-terminal Tyr-Pro from both, neuropeptide Y and peptide YY, with very high specific activities and Km values in the micromolar range, but almost no Ala-Pro from pancreatic polypeptide. Other proline-specific aminopeptidases exhibited low (aminopeptidase P, liberation of N-terminal Tyr) or totally no activity (dipeptidyl peptidase II), as was also observed with less-specific aminopeptidases (aminopeptidase M, leucine aminopeptidase). When human serum was incubated with neuropeptide Y or peptide YY at micro- and nanomolar concentrations, Tyr-Pro was detected as a metabolite of both peptides. Formation of Tyr-Pro in serum was blocked in the presence of Lys-pyrrolidine and diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile), specific, competitive inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Incubation of neuropeptide Y or peptide YY with immunocytochemically defined, cultivated endothelial cells from human umbilical cord also yielded Tyr-Pro. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV could be immunostained on most endothelial cells by a specific antibody. We suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase IV might be involved in the degradation of neuropeptide Y and peptide YY to N-terminal truncated neuropeptide Y(3-36) and peptide YY(3-36). Since specific binding to Y1, but not to Y2 subtype of neuropeptide Y/peptide YY receptors requires intact N- as well as C-termini of neuropeptide Y and peptide YY, removal of their amino-terminal dipeptides by dipeptidyl peptidase IV inactivates them for binding to one receptor subtype.},

  abstract = {Peptides of the glucagon/vasoactive-intestinal-peptide (VIP) peptide family share a considerable sequence similarity at their N-terminus. They either start with Tyr-Ala, His-Ala or His-Ser which might be in part potential targets for dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, a highly specialized aminopeptidase removing dipeptides only from peptides with N-terminal penultimate proline or alanine. Growth-hormone-releasing factor (1-29)amide and gastric inhibitory peptide/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) with terminal Tyr-Ala as well as glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)amide/insulinotropin [GLP-1(7-36)amide] and peptide histidine methionine (PHM) with terminal His-Ala were hydrolysed to their des-Xaa-Ala derivatives by dipeptidyl-peptidase IV purified from human placenta. VIP with terminal His-Ser was not significantly degraded by the peptidase. The kinetics of the hydrolysis of GIP, GLP-1(7-36)amide and PHM were analyzed in detail. For these peptides Km values of 4-34 microM and Vmax values of 0.6-3.8 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1 were determined for the purified peptidase which should allow their enzymic degradation also at physiological, nanomolar concentrations. When human serum was incubated with GIP or GLP-1(7-36)amide the same fragments as with the purified dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, namely the des-Xaa-Ala peptides and Tyr-Ala in the case of GIP or His-Ala in the case of GLP-1(7-36)amide, were identified as the main degradation products of these peptide hormones. Incorporation of inhibitors specific for dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, 1 mM Lys-pyrrolidide or 0.1 mM diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile), completely abolished the production of these fragments by serum. It is concluded that dipeptidyl-peptidase IV initiates the metabolism of GIP and GLP-1(7-36)amide in human serum. Since an intact N-terminus is obligate for the biological activity of the members of the glucagon/VIP peptide family [e. g. GIP(3-42) is known to be inactive to release insulin in the presence of glucose as does intact GIP], dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV action inactivates these peptide hormones. The relevance of this finding for their inactivation and their determination by immunoassays is discussed.},

USA F344 rats possess normal activity of this enzyme and served as matched controls. Intestinal brush-border membranes from the control rats were able to hydrolyze several proline-containing peptides. The hydrolytic ability of the brush-border membranes from the Japan rats against these peptides was markedly low. The difference in the hydrolytic activities between the two groups of rats was solely due to the absence of DPP IV in the Japan rats. There was no difference in the growth rate between the two groups of rats fed a reference diet whose protein constituents were not rich in proline. When the protein source was changed to gliadin, a proline-rich protein, USA F344 rats maintained their body weight for a 4-wk period on this diet, whereas the Japan rats experienced a significant weight loss under similar conditions. In situ perfusion experiments in intact animals revealed that the ability of morphiceptin (a peptide primarily hydrolyzable by DPP IV), when administered into the intestinal lumen, to block the cholera toxin-induced water secretion was significantly greater in Japan F344 rats than in USA F344 rats, indicating the resistance of morphiceptin to hydrolytic breakdown in the intestinal lumen of the Japan rats. It is concluded that the intestinal DPP IV plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of prolyl peptides and assimilation of proline-rich proteins.},

A theoretical analysis of the cytochrome c family demonstrates the ability to identify protein sequences in the PIR database with a high degree of accuracy using a set of six predicted tryptic peptide masses. This method was also applied to experimentally determined peptide masses for a small GTP-binding protein, a protein from pig uterus, the human sex steroid binding protein, and a thermostable DNA polymerase. The results demonstrate that a set of observed masses which is less than 50% of the total number of predicted masses can be used to identify a protein sequence in the database. For the analysis presented in this paper, a mass matching tolerance of 1 amu is used. Under these conditions, mass maps created by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight would also be applicable. In cases where multiple matches are observed or verification of the protein identification is needed, tandem mass spectrometry sequencing can be used to establish sequence similarity.},

  abstract = {The human fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP alpha) is a M(r) 95,000 cell surface antigen selectively expressed in reactive stromal fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, granulation tissue of healing wounds, and malignant cells of bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Normal adult tissues are generally FAP alpha-, but some fetal mesenchymal tissues transiently express the molecule. Because of its restricted normal tissue distribution and abundant expression in the stroma of over 90% of breast, colorectal, and lung carcinomas, FAP alpha is under clinical evaluation as a target for immunodetection and immunotherapy of epithelial cancers. In the present study, we have isolated a full-length cDNA for FAP alpha through expression cloning in COS-1 cells. The FAP alpha cDNA codes for a type II integral membrane protein with a large extracellular domain, transmembrane segment, and short cytoplasmic tail. FAP alpha shows 48% amino acid sequence identity to the T-cell activation antigen CD26, a membrane-bound protein with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity; however, unlike FAP alpha, CD26 is widely expressed in normal tissues. Three catalytic domains shared by DPPIV homologues in different species and by other serine proteases are conserved in FAP alpha. Immunochemical analysis of COS-1 cells coexpressing FAP alpha and CD26 revealed that the two molecules form heteromeric cell surface complexes, suggesting that a previously identified FAP alpha-associated M(r) 105,000 protein of cultured fibroblasts and growth factor-stimulated melanocytes, FAP beta, is identical to CD26. In vivo coexpression of FAP alpha and CD26 is found in reactive fibroblasts of healing wounds but not in tumor stromal fibroblasts or sarcomas (FAP alpha +/CD26-). The putative serine protease activity of FAP alpha and its in vivo induction pattern may indicate a role for this molecule in the control of fibroblast growth or epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development, tissue repair, and epithelial carcinogenesis.},

  abstract = {The metabolism of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) has not been studied in detail, but it is known to be rapidly cleared from the circulation. Measurement by RIA is hampered by the fact that most antisera are side-viewing or C-terminally directed, and recognize both intact GLP-1 and biologically inactive. N-terminally truncated fragments. Using high pressure liquid chromatography in combination with RIAs, methodology allowing specific determination of both intact GLP-1 and its metabolites was developed. Human plasma was shown to degrade GLP-1-(7-36)amide, forming an N-terminally truncated peptide with a t1/2 of 20.4 +/- 1.4 min at 37 C (n = 6). This was unaffected by EDTA or aprotinin. Inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV or low temperature (4 C) completely prevented formation of the metabolite, which was confirmed to be GLP-1-(9-36)amide by mass spectrometry and sequence analysis. High pressure liquid chromatography revealed the concentration of GLP-1-(9-36)amide to be 53.5 +/- 13.7% of the concentration of endogenous intact GLP-1 in the fasted state, which increased to 130.8 +/- 10.0% (P < 0.01; n = 6) 1 h postprandially. Metabolism at the C-terminus was not observed. This study suggests that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV is the primary mechanism for GLP-1 degradation in human plasma in vitro and may have a role in inactivating the peptide in vivo.},

  abstract = {Prolyl oligopeptidase was isolated and purified to homogeneity from human lymphocytes, yielding a specific activity of 7780 mU/mg. The molecular mass using size-exclusion chromatography matches the 76 kDa obtained by SDS/PAGE. This provides evidence that prolyl oligopeptidase is a monomer. The isoelectric point is 4.8 as judged by isoelectric focusing in free solution. Di-isopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride completely abolish the activity, classifying the enzyme as a serine proteinase. The inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid indicates the importance of a free sulfhydryl group near the active-site. alpha(1)-Casein and ornithine decarboxylase, two proteins containing a PEST sequence, inhibit prolyl oligopeptidase, but were not hydrolyzed. This demonstrates that prolyl oligopeptidase is not participating in the metabolism of proteins according to a PEST-dependent pathway. alpha(1)-Antitrypsin partially inhibits the enzyme but in contrast, aprotinin does not. Its inability to cleave corticotropin-releasing factor, ubiquitin, albumin and aprotinin, together with the hydrolysis of bradykinin between Pro7-Arg8 confirms the affinity of prolyl oligopeptidase for small peptides. Multiple sequence alignment does not reveal any similarity with proteases of known tertiary structure. Secondary-structure prediction displays striking similarity with dipeptidyl peptidase IV and acylaminoacyl peptidase. Two characteristic features of the members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases are highlighted: the linear arrangement of the catalytic triad is nucleophile-acid-base and the proteolytic cleavage releasing the catalytically active C-terminal region of around 500 amino acids from the N-terminal sequence. Secondary structure prediction and comparison of the active-site of serine proteinases with known three-dimensional coordinates prove that Asp641 is the third member of the catalytic triad. The secondary structural organization of the protease domain of prolyl oligopeptidase is in accordance with the alpha/beta hydrolase fold.},

  abstract = {The combined actions of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and truncated glucagon-like peptide-1 (tGLP-1) may fully account for the incretin effect. These hormones are released from the small intestine in response to oral glucose and stimulate insulin release. Recently, evidence has been provided demonstrating the degradation of GIP-(1-42) and GLP-1-(7-36)NH2 by the serum enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) into the biologically inactive products GIP-(3-42) and GLP-1-(9-36)NH2. The objective of the current investigation was to develop a method to monitor the degradation of these hormones in vivo. Synthetic peptides were radiolabeled and purified by HPLC. Subsequent degradation of the peptides under various conditions was then monitored by further HPLC analysis. Incubation of [125I]GIP-(1-42) or [125I]GLP-1-(7-36)NH2 with Wistar rat serum or purified DPP IV resulted in the major N-terminal-truncated products [125I]GIP-(3-42) and [125I]GLP-1-(9-36)NH2. These products were significantly reduced when the specific DPP IV inhibitor diprotin A was included in the incubation mixture and were absent when serum from DPP IV-deficient rats was used. When the labeled peptides were infused into rats at hormone levels within the physiological range, over 50% was metabolized to the truncated forms within 2 min. These products were absent when the tracers were infused into DPP IV-deficient animals. It is concluded that DPP IV may be a primary inactivating enzyme of both GIP and tGLP-1 in vivo. As the N-terminal-truncated products of the DPP IV cleavage may not be distinguished from the biologically active hormone by currently employed assays, reports of circulating hormone levels should be reconsidered. The method described in this manuscript may be useful for investigating the durations of action of GIP and tGLP-1 in normal and pathophysiological conditions.},

  abstract = {Many biologically important peptide sequences contain proline. It confers unique conformational constraints on the peptide chain in that the side-chain is cyclized back onto the backbone amide position. Inside an alpha-helix the possibility of making hydrogen bonds to the preceding turn is lost and a kink will be introduced. The conformational restrictions imposed by proline motifs in a peptide chain appear to imply important structural or biological functions as can be deduced from their often remarkably high degree of conservation as found in many proteins and peptides, especially cytokines, growth factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, V3 loops of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120, and neuro- and vasoactive peptides. Only a limited number of peptidases are known to be able to hydrolyze proline adjacent bonds. Their activity is influenced by the isomeric state (cis-trans) as well as the position of proline in the peptide chain. The three proline specific metallo-peptidases (aminopeptidase P, carboxypeptidase P and prolidase) are activated by Mn2+, whereas the three serine type peptidases cleaving a post proline bond (prolyl oligopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and prolylcarboxypeptidase) share the sequential order of the catalytic Ser-Asp-His triade, which differentiates them from the chymotrypsin (His-Asp-Ser) and subtilisin (Asp-His-Ser) families. An endo or C terminal Pro-Pro bond and an endo pre-Pro peptide bond possess a high degree of resistance to any mammalian proteolytic enzyme.},

These peptidases cover practically all situations where a proline residue might occur in a potential substrate. In this paper we endeavour to discuss these enzymes, particularly those responsible for peptide or protein hydrolysis at proline sites. We have detailed their discovery, biochemical attributes and substrate specificities and have provided information as to the methodology used to detect and manipulate their activities. We have also described the roles, or potential roles that these enzymes may play physiologically and the consequences of their dysfunction in varied disease states.},

We demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), shown to be highly intestinotrophic in mice, promotes an increase in intestinal villus height but has no trophic effect on small bowel weight in rats. The reduced intestinotrophic activity of GLP-2 in rats is attributable to inactivation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). GLP-2(1-33) was degraded to GLP-2(3-33) following incubation with human placental DPP-IV or rat serum but not by serum from DPP-IV-deficient rats. Administration of rat GLP-2 to DPP-IV-deficient rats was associated with markedly increased bioactivity of rat GLP-2 resulting in a significant increase in small bowel weight. A synthetic GLP-2 analog, r[Gly2]GLP-2, with an alanine to glycine substitution at position 2, was resistant to cleavage by both DPP-IV and rat serum in vitro. Treatment of wild-type rats with r[Gly2]GLP-2 produced a statistically significant increase in small bowel mass. DPP-IV-mediated inactivation of GLP-2 is a critical determinant of the growth factor-like properties of GLP-2.},

Several chemo-kines, including RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), have now been shown to be substrates for recombinant soluble human CD26. The truncated RANTES(3-68) lacked the ability of native RANTES(1-68) to increase the cytosolic calcium concentration in human monocytes, but still induced this response in macrophages activated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Analysis of chemokine receptor messenger RNAs and patterns of desensitization of chemokine responses showed that the differential activity of the truncated molecule results from an altered receptor specificity. RANTES(3-68) showed a reduced activity, relative to that of RANTES(1-68), with cells expressing the recombinant CCR1 chemokine receptor, but retained the ability to stimulate CCR5 receptors and to inhibit the cytopathic effects of HIV-1. Our results indicate that CD26-mediated processing together with cell activation-induced changes in receptor expression provides an integrated mechanism for differential cell recruitment and for the regulation of target cell specificity of RANTES, and possibly other chemokines.},

  abstract = {The 170-kDa membrane-bound gelatinase, seprase, is a cell surface protease, the expression of which correlates with the invasive phenotype of human melanoma and carcinoma cells. We have isolated seprase from cell membranes and shed vesicles of LOX human melanoma cells. The active enzyme is a dimer of N-glycosylated 97-kDa subunits. Sequence analysis of three internal proteolytic fragments of the 97-kDa polypeptide revealed up to 87.5% identity to the 95-kDa fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPalpha), the function of which is unknown. Thus, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to generate a 2.4-kilobase cDNA from LOX mRNA with FAPalpha primers. COS-7 cells transfected with this cDNA expressed a 170-kDa gelatinase that is recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against seprase. Sequence analysis also showed similarities to the 110-kDa subunit of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). Like DPPIV, the gelatinase activity of seprase was completely blocked by serine-protease inhibitors, including diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Seprase could be affinity-labeled by [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate, but the proteolytically inactive 97-kDa subunit could not, confirming the existence of a serine protease active site on the dimeric form. Proteolytic activity is lost upon dissociation into its 97-kDa subunit following treatment with acid, heat, or cysteine and histidine-modifying agents. We conclude that seprase, FAPalpha, and DPPIV are related serine integral membrane proteases and that seprase is similar to DPPIV, the proteolytic activities of which are dependent upon subunit association.},

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) expressed on rat lung capillary endothelia is shown here to be an adhesion receptor for rat breast cancer cells and to mediate lung colonization by these tumor cells. Fibronectin (FN) assembled on breast cancer cell surfaces into multiple, randomly dispersed globules from cellular and plasma FN is identified as the principal ligand for DPP IV. Ligand expression correlates quantitatively with the tumor cells' capabilities to bind to DPP IV and to metastasize to the lungs. DPP IV/FN-mediated adhesion and metastasis are blocked when tumor cells are incubated with soluble DPP IV prior to conducting adhesion and lung colony assays. Adhesion is also blocked by anti-DPP IV monoclonal antibody 6A3 and anti-FN antiserum. However, adhesion to immobilized FN is unaffected by soluble plasma FN and, thus, can happen during hematogenous spread of cancer cells at high plasma FN concentrations. The ability of many cancer cells to capture FN molecules on their surface and to augment such deposits by FN self-association during passage in the blood suggests that DPP IV/FN binding may be a relatively common mechanism for lung metastasis.},

Moreover, the chemotactic activity of SDF-1alpha also disappeared specifically by DPPIV activity of recombinant soluble CD26. These results suggested that dissemination of T-tropic HIV strains in vivo may be facilitated by CD26/DPPIV via inactivation of functional SDF-1alpha.},

In chemotaxis and intracellular calcium mobilization assays, the truncation caused a reduction in the specific activity of RANTES but not of GCP-2. The serine protease CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV) could induce this observed NH2-terminal truncation of GCP-2 and RANTES but not that of the monocyte chemotactic proteins MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3. No significant difference in neutrophil activation was detected between intact and CD26/DPP IV-truncated GCP-2. In contrast to intact natural RANTES(1-68), which still chemoattracts monocytes at 10 ng/ml, CD26/DPP IV-truncated RANTES(3-68) was inactive at 300 ng/ml and behaved as a natural chemotaxis inhibitor. Compared with intact RANTES, only a 10-fold higher concentration of RANTES(3-68) induced a significant Ca2+ response. Furthermore, RANTES(3-68) inhibited infection of mononuclear cells by an M-tropic HIV-1 strain 5-fold more efficiently than intact RANTES. Thus, proteolytic processing of RANTES by CD26/DPP IV may constitute an important regulatory mechanism during anti-inflammatory and antiviral responses.},

  abstract = {CD26 is a leukocyte-activation antigen that is expressed on T lymphocytes and macrophages and possesses dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity, whose natural substrates have not been identified yet. CXC chemokines, stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and 1beta (SDF-1beta), sharing the receptor CXCR-4, are highly efficacious chemoattractants for resting lymphocytes and CD34(+) progenitor cells, and they efficiently block the CXCR-4-mediated entry into cells of T cell line tropic strains of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Here we show that both the chemotactic and antiviral activities of these chemokines are abrogated by DPPIV-mediated specific removal of the N-terminal dipeptide, not only when the chemokines are produced in transformed mouse L cell line to express human CD26 but also when they were exposed to a human T cell line (H9) physiologically expressing CD26. Mutagenesis of SDF-1alpha confirmed the critical requirement of the N-terminal dipeptide for its chemotactic and antiviral activities. These data suggest that CD26-mediated cleavage of SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta likely occurs in human bodies and promotes HIV-1 replication and disease progression. They may also explain why memory function of CD4(+) cells is preferentially lost in HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, CD26 would modulate various other biological processes in which SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta are involved.},

Using two-colour immunofluorescence analysis with CD26 and CD20 or CD23 monoclonal antibodies, CD26 was found undetectable on peripheral resting B-cells (CD20+ CD23-) from normal donors whereas it was expressed on B-cells activated in vitro with interleukin (IL)-4 and Staphylococcus aureus strain cowan I (CD20+ CD23+). The expression of CD26 on leukaemic B-cells (CD20+ CD23+) was clearly induced in 22 out of 25 patients examined. Consequently, induced levels of CD26 cell surface expression on either normal activated and malignant B-cells coincided with the enhancement of DPP IV activity detected on the surface of these cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the transcript levels of the CD26 gene was higher in normal activated B-cells and B-CLL cells than in resting B-cells, suggesting that CD26 was expressed at the level of transcriptional activation. These observations provide evidence of the abnormal expression of DPPIV/CD26 in B-CLL which, therefore, may be considered as a novel marker for B-CLL. Further investigation in relation to CD26 expression and other B malignancies needs to be defined.},

Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were isolated and immunostained. Recombinant FAP and immunopurified, natural FAP were analyzed for protease activities and similarities to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), a structurally related enzyme. FAP-specific messenger RNA and immunoreactivity were detected in cirrhotic, but not normal, livers. FAP immunoreactivity was most intense on perisinusoidal cells of the periseptal regions within regenerative nodules (15 of 15 cases); this pattern coincides with the tissue remodelling interface. In addition, human FAP was expressed by cells within the fibrous septa (10 of 15 cases). Cell morphology, location, and colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) indicated that FAP is present on HSC in vivo. Similarly, isolated HSC expressed FAP in vitro. Both natural FAP from cirrhotic liver and recombinant FAP were shown to have gelatinase and dipeptidyl peptidase activities. FAP is a cell-bound, dual-specificity dipeptidyl peptidase and gelatinase expressed by activated HSC at the tissue remodelling interface in human cirrhosis.

In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

This second cleavage after a Gly residue demonstrated that the substrate specificity of this protease is less restricted than anticipated. The unusual processing of MDC by CD26/DPP TV was confirmed on the synthetic peptides GPYGANMED (MDC(1-9)) and YGANMED (MDC(3-9)). Compared with intact MDC(1-69), CD26/DPP IV-processed MDC(5-69) had reduced chemotactic activity on lymphocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, showed impaired mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) through CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), and was unable to desensitize for MDC-induced Ca(2+)-responses in CCR4 transfectants. However, MDC(5-69) remained equally chemotactic as intact MDC(1-69) on monocytes. In contrast to the reduced binding to lymphocytes and CCR4 transfectants, MDC(5-69) retained its binding properties to monocytes and its anti-HIV-l activity. Thus, NH(2)-terminal truncation of MDC by CD26/DPP TV has profound biological consequences and may be an important regulatory mechanism during the migration of Th2 lymphocytes and dendritic cells to germinal centers and to sites of inflammation.},

  abstract = {The tetrapeptide, endomorphin-2 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-PheNH2) possesses high affinity for mu opioid receptors, and produces potent analgesia in mice. Its structure appears to satisfy the substrate requirements of the proteinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV which removes dipeptides from the amino terminus of peptides containing proline as the penultimate amino acid. A potent, stable and specific inhibitor of this enzyme, Ala-Pyrrolidonyl-2-nitrile, has been described which should potentiate endomorphin-2-induced analgesia. Further, since dipeptidyl peptidase IV has an absolute requirement for l-Pro, a more metabolically-stable d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 analog should produce longer analgesic actions at lower doses. The present study found that endomorphin-2 was degraded approximately twice as fast than the chromogenic substrate, Ala-Pro-2naphthylamide, by dipeptidyl peptidase IV, whereas d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 was totally resistant to this enzyme's action. d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 (ED50=0.05 microg) was more potent than endomorphin-2 (ED50=30 microg) in significantly increasing tail-flick latencies with longer durations of action. Both the peptide and analogue were equipotent (ED50=0.5 microg) in significantly increasing jump thresholds. Ala-Pyrrolidonyl-2-nitrile (10-75 nmol) elicited a dose-dependent analgesia, and potentiated the analgesic actions of endomorphin-2, particularly on the tail-flick test. Whereas systemic naltrexone (2.5, 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently eliminated each of the three forms of analgesia on the jump test as well as the peak (15 min) effect on the tail-flick test, analgesia elicited by either endomorphin-2, d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 or Ala-Pyrrolidonyl-2-nitrile returned after 30-60 min in naltrexone-treated rats on the tail-flick test. These data strongly suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase IV plays a role in the inactivation of endomorphin-2 in vivo, and thereby modulates its central analgesic actions.},

  abstract = {Chemokines attract and activate distinct sets of leukocytes. The CC chemokine eotaxin has been characterized as an important mediator in allergic reactions because it selectively attracts eosinophils, Th2 lymphocytes, and basophils. Human eotaxin has a penultimate proline, indicating that it might be a substrate for dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV). In this study we demonstrate that eotaxin is efficiently cleaved by CD26/DPP IV and that the NH2-terminal truncation affects its biological activity. CD26/DPP IV-truncated eotaxin(3-74) showed reduced chemotactic activity for eosinophils and impaired binding and signaling properties through the CC chemokine receptor 3. Moreover, eotaxin(3-74) desensitized calcium signaling and inhibited chemotaxis toward intact eotaxin. In addition, HIV-2 infection of CC chemokine receptor 3-transfected cells was inhibited to a similar extent by eotaxin and eotaxin(3-74). Thus, CD26/DPP IV differently regulates the chemotactic and antiviral potencies of eotaxin by the removal of two NH2-terminal residues. This physiological processing may be an important down-regulatory mechanism, limiting eotaxin-mediated inflammatory responses.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a cell surface peptidase expressed by normal melanocytes, epithelial cells, and other cells. Malignant cells, including melanomas and carcinomas, frequently lose or alter DPPIV cell surface expression. Loss of DPPIV expression occurs during melanoma progression at a stage where transformed melanocytes become independent of exogenous growth factors for survival. Tetracycline-inducible expression vectors were constructed to express DPPIV in human melanoma cells. Reexpressing DPPIV in melanoma cells at or below levels expressed by normal melanocytes induced a profound change in phenotype that was characteristic of normal melanocytes. DPPIV expression led to a loss of tumorigenicity, anchorage-independent growth, a reversal in a block in differentiation, and an acquired dependence on exogenous growth factors for cell survival. Suppression of tumorigenicity and reversal of a block in differentiation were dependent on serine protease activity, assessed using mutant DPPIV molecules containing serine-->alanine substitutions. Surprisingly, dependence on exogenous growth factors was not dependent on serine protease activity. Reexpression of either wild-type or mutant DPPIV rescued expression of a second putative cell surface serine peptidase, fibroblast activation protein alpha, which can form a heterodimer with DPPIV. This observation suggests that rescue of fibroblast activation protein alpha may play a role in regulating growth of melanocytic cells. These results support the view that downregulation of DPPIV is an important early event in the pathogenesis of melanoma.},

Suitable analytical procedures were developed involving the use of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for purification of the enzymatic degradation products and a peptide mapping procedure for evaluating the enzymatic degradation of the large precursor protein chromogranin A. While vasostatin I was found to be a substrate for dipeptidyl peptidase IV, no N-terminal cleavage of Leu-Pro could be noted for chromogranin A. With respect to vasostatin II, N-terminal degradation was only observed after degradation in the C-terminal domain to proteins containing less than or equal to 78 amino acids. The specificity of the N-terminal release of Leu-Pro was proved by addition of a DPP IV specific inhibitor. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has been implicated in tumor growth and cirrhosis. Here we describe DPP8, a novel human postproline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase that is homologous to DPPIV and FAP. Northern-blot hybridization showed that the tissue expression of DPP8 mRNA is ubiquitous, similar to that of DPPIV. The DPP8 gene was localized to chromosome 15q22, distinct from a closely related gene at 19p13.3 which we named DPP9. The full-length DPP8 cDNA codes for an 882-amino-acid protein that has about 27% identity and 51% similarity to DPPIV and FAP, but no transmembrane domain and no N-linked or O-linked glycosylation. Western blots and confocal microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells showed DPP8 to be a 100-kDa monomeric protein expressed in the cytoplasm. Purified recombinant DPP8 hydrolyzed the DPPIV substrates Ala-Pro, Arg-Pro and Gly-Pro. Thus recombinant DPP8 shares a postproline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity with DPPIV and FAP. DPP8 enzyme activity had a neutral pH optimum consistent with it being nonlysosomal. The similarities between DPP8 and DPPIV in tissue expression pattern and substrates suggests a potential role for DPP8 in T-cell activation and immune function.},

Although the function of the high concentration of serum-soluble CD26 (sCD26) is unknown, it may be related to the cleavage of biologically active polypeptides. As CD26 or enzymatic activity levels were previously associated with cancer, we examined the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of preoperative sCD26 measurements by ELISA in colorectal carcinoma patients. We found a highly significant difference between sCD26 levels in healthy donors (mean 559.7 +/- 125.5 microg l(-1)) and cancer patients (mean 261.7 +/- 138.1 microg l(-1)) (P< 0.001). A cut-off at 410 microg l(-1)gave 90% sensitivity with 90% specificity which means that the diagnostic efficiency of sCD26 is higher than that shown by other markers, particularly in patients at early stages. Moreover, sCD26 as a variable is not related with Dukes' stage classification, age, gender, tumour location or degree of differentiation. With a follow-up of 2 years until recurrence, preliminary data show that sCD26 can be managed as a prognostic variable of early carcinoma patients. In addition, the origin of sCD26 is discussed.},

  abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), an intestinal product of glucagon gene expression which induces intestinal growth in mice, has been proposed as a treatment for intestinal insufficiency. GLP-2 is metabolized extensively by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) in rats, but less is known about its fate in humans. Therefore, GLP-2 metabolism was investigated in healthy volunteers after 1) a 500-Cal mixed meal (n = 6), 2) iv infusion of synthetic human GLP-2 (0.8 pmol/kg x min; n = 8), 3) a sc bolus injection (400 microg; n = 9), and 4) in vitro incubation in plasma and blood (1,000 pmol/L; n = 4). GLP-2 concentrations were determined by N-terminal RIA measuring only intact GLP-2, side-viewing RIA measuring intact and degraded forms [e.g. GLP-2-(3-33) arising from DPP-IV degradation], and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Meal ingestion elevated plasma GLP-2 (intact, 16 +/- 3 to 73 +/- 10 pmol/L at 90 min), and HPLC revealed two immunoreactive components: intact GLP-2 (57 +/- 2%) and GLP-2-(3-33). GLP-2 infusion increased plasma levels [intact, 9 +/- 4 to 131 +/- 11 pmol/L; total, 23 +/- 7 to 350 +/- 18 pmol/L; the differences represent GLP-2-(3-33)]. The elimination t(1/2) values were 7.2 +/- 2 min (intact GLP-2) and 27.4 +/- 5.4 min [GLP-2-(3-33)], and MCRs were 6.8 +/- 0.6 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 mL/kg x min, respectively. Subcutaneous injection increased intact GLP-2 to maximally 1,493 +/- 250 pmol/L at 45 min, whereas total GLP-2 increased to 2,793 +/- 477 pmol/L at 90 min. At 60 min, plasma contained 69 +/- 1% intact GLP-2. In vitro the t(1/2) values were 8.0 +/- 1.5 h (plasma) and 3.3 +/- 0.3 h (blood). GLP-2-(3-33) was the only degradation product identified by HPLC, and a DPP-IV inhibitor abolished the degradation of GLP-2 in vitro. We conclude that GLP-2 is extensively degraded to GLP-2-(3-33) in humans, presumably by DPP-IV. Nevertheless, 69% remains intact 1 h after GLP-2 injection, supporting the possibility of sc use in patients with intestinal insufficiency.},

Demuth, K. Glund, U. Heiser, J. Pospisilik, S. Hinke, T. Hoffmann, F. Rosche, D. Schlenzig, M. Wermann, C. McIntosh, and R. Pederson, manuscript in preparation). In the current study, the biological activity of these peptides was examined in vitro. The amino-terminally truncated peptides all behaved as partial agonists in cyclic AMP stimulation assays, with Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells overexpressing the human glucagon receptor (potency: glucagon(1-29) > [pGlu(3)]glu- cagon(3-29) > glucagon(3-29) > glucagon(5-29) > [Glu(9)]glu- cagon(2-29)). In competition binding experiments, [pGlu(3)]glucagon(3-29) and glucagon(5-29) both demonstrated 5-fold lower affinity for the receptor than glucagon(1-29), whereas glucagon(3-29) exhibited 18-fold lower affinity. Of the peptides tested, only glucagon(5-29) showed antagonist activity, and this was weak compared with the classical glucagon antagonist, [Glu(9)]glucagon(2-29). Hence, DPIV hydrolysis of glucagon yields low affinity agonists of the glucagon receptor. As a corollary to evidence indicating that DPIV degrades glucagon (Demuth, et al., manuscript in preparation), DPIV-resistant analogs were synthesized. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was used to assess DPIV resistance, and it allowed kinetic analysis of degradation. Of several analogs generated, only [D-Ser(2)] and [Gly(2)]glucagon retained high affinity binding and biological potency, similar to native glucagon in vitro. [D-Ser(2)]Glucagon exhibited enhanced hyperglycemic activity in a bioassay, whereas [Gly(2)]glucagon was not completely resistant to DPIV degradation.},

  abstract = {Proteomics, the large-scale analysis of proteins, will contribute greatly to our understanding of gene function in the post-genomic era. Proteomics can be divided into three main areas: (1) protein micro-characterization for large-scale identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications; (2) 'differential display' proteomics for comparison of protein levels with potential application in a wide range of diseases; and (3) studies of protein-protein interactions using techniques such as mass spectrometry or the yeast two-hybrid system. Because it is often difficult to predict the function of a protein based on homology to other proteins or even their three-dimensional structure, determination of components of a protein complex or of a cellular structure is central in functional analysis. This aspect of proteomic studies is perhaps the area of greatest promise. After the revolution in molecular biology exemplified by the ease of cloning by DNA methods, proteomics will add to our understanding of the biochemistry of proteins, processes and pathways for years to come.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a 110-kD, trans-membrane, ectoenzyme, with ubiquitous expression. DPPIV has numerous functions including involvement in T-cell activation, cell adhesion, digestion of proline containing peptides in the kidney and intestines, HIV infection and apoptosis, and regulation of tumorigenicity in certain melanoma cells. Constitutively expressed on numerous epithelial cell types, DPPIV is often disregulated in a variety of human malignancies. The most striking evidence of DPPIV down-regulation is found in transformed melanocytes. where nearly 100% of melanomas lack DPPIV expression. We have identified DPPIV as a gene that can alter the invasive potential of a number of melanoma cell lines. By transfecting the full-length cDNA of DPPIV, we have established stable melanoma cell lines that express comparable levels of the DPPIV protein as normal epidermal melanocytes. Matrigel invasion assays were utilized to study the effects of DPPIV expression on the invasive potential of these cells. The parental and vector transfectants readily migrated across the Matrigel while the invasiveness of DPPIV transfected cells was reduced by greater than 75%. The effects on cellular invasion are not attributed to overall growth characteristics, as both DPPIV expressing and non-expressing cells behave comparably in culture. We have also constructed mutants of DPPIV that lack either the extra-cellular serine protease activity or the six amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Both mutants were stably expressed in melanoma cells. Matrigel invasion assays performed with cells expressing the two mutant forms of the protein revealed phenotypic effects similar to wild type function. In this study. we have demonstrated that expression of a proteolytically active form of the DPPIV protein inhibits the invasiveness of malignant melanoma cell lines lacking endogenous DPPIV expression. Furthermore, we have shown that neither the protease activity nor the cytoplasmic domain of DPPIV is required for its anti-invasive activity.},

  abstract = {Chemokines are proinflammatory cytokines that play a role in leukocyte migration and activation. Recent reports showed that RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted chemokine), eotaxin, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are NH(2)-terminally truncated by the lymphocyte surface glycoprotein and protease CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV). Removal of the NH(2)-terminal dipeptide resulted in impaired inflammatory properties of RANTES, eotaxin, MDC, and SDF-1. The potential CD26/DPP IV substrate macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) and the related chemokine, LD78alpha (ie, one of the MIP-1alpha isoforms), were not affected by this protease. However, CD26/DPP IV cleaved LD78beta, a most potent CCR5 binding chemokine and inhibitor of macrophage tropic human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, into LD78beta(3-70). Naturally truncated LD78beta(3-70), but not truncated MIP-1beta, was recovered as an abundant chemokine form from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast to all other chemokines processed by CD26/DPP IV, LD78beta(3-70) had increased chemotactic activity in comparison to intact LD78beta. With a minimal effective concentration of 30 pmol/L, LD78beta(3-70) became the most efficient monocyte chemoattractant. LD78beta(3-70) retained its high capacity to induce an intracellular calcium increase in CCR5-transfected cells. Moreover, on CCR1 transfectants, truncated LD78beta(3-70) was 30-fold more potent than intact LD78beta. Thus, CD26/DPP IV can exert not only a negative but also a positive feedback during inflammation by increasing the specific activity of LD78beta. CD26/DPP IV-cleaved LD78beta(3-70) is the most potent CCR1 and CCR5 agonist that retains strong anti-HIV-1 activity, indicating the importance of the chemokine-protease interaction in normal and pathologic conditions.

  abstract = {N-terminal sequence analysis by Edman chemistry continues to play an important role in the structural analysis of proteins and peptides. Improvements in the sensitivity of the method have been achieved mainly at the level of increasing the sensitivity of the on-line analysis of PTH amino acids by RP-HPLC (reverse phase high performance chromatography). Using microbore columns (0.8-1.0 mm), it is possible to run standards at the 0.5-1.0 pmol level and to sequence samples in the 1-5 pmol range. Due to constraints in current chromatographic methods, it is unlikely that further improvements in sensitivity will be achieved by this approach alone. Although alternative Edman reagents, including fluorescent chemistries, have promised to increase the sensitivity of sequencing into the low femtomole range, none of the methods have progressed into routine usage. These reagents and chemistries are critically evaluated in this review, and the problems which have prevented their further development discussed. Instrumental constraints are also considered. It is concluded that the development of more sensitive methods requires further research into both the chemistry and the instrumentation, and that alternative separation and detection methods may also play a role.},

ENI is a recently isolated mu-opiate receptor agonist with high selectivity and specificity for this receptor subtype. Stability studies were conducted in various buffers and the drug was shown to be stable in both acidic and basic buffer systems. In the presence of full thickness porcine buccal epithelium, ENI was unstable with only 23.4+/-15.7% intact drug present after 6 h. The region responsible for this degradation was found to coincide with the major barrier region of the buccal epithelium as delineated through stability experiments in the presence of partial thickness buccal epithelium. Various peptidase inhibitors were used to isolate the enzyme(s) responsible for this degradation. Diprotin-A, a potent inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, provided significant inhibition of the degradation of ENI in the presence of buccal epithelium. In vitro permeation studies revealed that the permeability coefficient of ENI across porcine buccal epithelium was 5.67+/-4.74x10(-7) cm/s. The enzymatic degradation of ENI was found not to be rate limiting to the drug's permeation across buccal epithelium, as diprotin-A did not increase the permeation of ENI. Sodium glycocholate as well as sodium taurocholate were also ineffective in enhancing the permeation of ENI across porcine buccal epithelium.},

A fully automatic and reliable prediction system for protein subcellular localization is needed, especially for the analysis of large-scale genome sequences.

The total prediction accuracies reach 91.4% for three subcellular locations in prokaryotic organisms and 79.4% for four locations in eukaryotic organisms. Predictions by our approach are robust to errors in the protein N-terminal sequences.

  abstract = {Chemokines coordinate many aspects of leukocyte migration. As chemoattractants they play an important role in the innate and acquired immune response. There is good experimental evidence that N-terminal truncation by secreted or cell surface proteases is a way of modulating chemokine action. The localization of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV on cell surfaces and in biological fluids, its primary specificity, and the type of naturally occurring truncated chemokines are consistent with such a function. We determined the steady-state catalytic parameters for a relevant selection of chemokines (CCL3b, CCL5, CCL11, CCL22, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL12) previously reported to alter their chemotactic behavior due to CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV-catalyzed truncation. The results reveal a striking selectivity for stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (CXCL12) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22). The kinetic parameters support the hypothesis that CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV contributes to the degradation of certain chemokines in vivo. The data not only provide insight into the selectivity of the enzyme for specific chemokines, but they also contribute to the general understanding of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV secondary substrate specificity.},

  abstract = {Glucagon is a 29-amino acid polypeptide released from pancreatic islet alpha-cells that acts to maintain euglycemia by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Despite its importance, there remains controversy about the mechanisms responsible for glucagon clearance in the body. In the current study, enzymatic metabolism of glucagon was assessed using sensitive mass spectrometric techniques to identify the molecular products. Incubation of glucagon with purified porcine dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) yielded sequential production of glucagon(3-29) and glucagon(5-29). In human serum, degradation to glucagon(3-29) was rapidly followed by N-terminal cyclization of glucagon, preventing further DP IV-mediated hydrolysis. Bioassay of glucagon, following incubation with purified DP IV or normal rat serum demonstrated a significant loss of hyperglycemic activity, while a similar incubation in DP IV-deficient rat serum did not show any loss of glucagon bioactivity. Degradation, monitored by mass spectrometry and bioassay, was blocked by the specific DP IV inhibitor, isoleucyl thiazolidine. These results identify DP IV as a primary enzyme involved in the degradation and inactivation of glucagon. These findings have important implications for the determination of glucagon levels in human plasma.},

  abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

  abstract = {Drug resistance has sharply limited the effectiveness of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in AIDS therapy. It is critically important to understand the basis of this resistance for designing new drugs. We have evaluated the free energy contribution of each residue in the HIV protease in binding to one of its substrates and to the five FDA-approved protease drugs. Analysis of these free energy profiles and the variability at each sequence position suggests: (i) single drug resistance mutations are likely to occur at not well conserved residues if they interact more favorably with drugs than with the substrate; and (ii) resistance-evading drugs should have a free energy profile similar to the substrate and interact most favorably with well conserved residues. We also propose an empirical parameter, called the free energy/variability value, which combines free energy calculation and sequence analysis to suggest possible drug resistance mutations on the protease. The free energy/variability value is defined as the product of one residue's contribution to the binding free energy and the variability of that residue. This parameter can assist in designing resistance-evading drugs for any target.},

  abstract = {The invasion of migratory cells through connective tissues involves metallo- and serine types of cell surface proteases. We show that formation of a novel protease complex, consisting of the membrane-bound prolyl peptidases seprase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), at invadopodia of migratory fibroblasts is a prerequisite for cell invasion and migration on a collagenous matrix. Seprase and DPPIV form a complex on the cell surface that elicits both gelatin binding and gelatinase activities localized at invadopodia of cells migrating on collagenous fibers. The protease complex participates in the binding to gelatin and localized gelatin degradation, cellular migration, and monolayer wound closure. Serine protease inhibitors can block the gelatinase activity and the localized gelatin degradation by cells. Antibodies to the gelatin-binding domain of DPPIV reduce the cellular abilities of the proteases to degrade gelatin but do not affect cellular adhesion or spreading on type I collagen. Furthermore, expression of the seprase-DPPIV complex is restricted to migratory cells involved in wound closure in vitro and in connective tissue cells during closure of gingival wounds but not in differentiated tissue cells. Thus, we have identified cell surface proteolytic activities, which are non-metalloproteases, seprase and DPPIV, that are responsible for the tissue-invasive phenotype.},

Previous studies suggested that the in vivo metabolism of GLP-1 is much faster than that of GLP-2. In this paper, we investigated the in vitro truncation of GLP-2 and GLP-1 by DPP IV. The slower conversion rate observed for GLP-2 compared to GLP-1 was due to an approximately 10-fold reduction in catalytic rate constant. The selectivity of DPP IV for the glucagon-like peptides was compared with data obtained for other natural substrates using the same enzyme source in identical conditions.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV/CD26) is a costimulatory molecule as well as a protease highly expressed on T cells. Purified DPP IV has been recognized to inactivate peptide hormones, neuropeptides, and some chemokines by cleavage behind a proline residue at the penultimate N-terminal amino acid position. Here, we identified another substrate for DPP IV among the chemokine family: the interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC/CXCL11). Using a specific DPP IV inhibitor, we demonstrate that DPP IV is responsible for the cleavage of the chemokine by PHA/IL-2-treated T cells. As PHA/IL-2-treated T cells also express the CXCL11 receptor (CXCR3), we investigated whether truncation of CXCL11 would modulate its biological activity for these cells. Truncated CXCL11 [CXCL11(3-73)] had an eightfold reduced potential to bind and to regulate CXCR3, but was completely inactive in calcium flux and chemotaxis assays. However, consistent with its reduced but still considerable ability to down-regulate CXCR3, truncated CXCL11 desensitized T cell chemotaxis in response to the intact chemokine. Hence, CXCL11-induced T cell recruitment may be regulated by DPP IV-mediated proteolytic inactivation of CXCL11 and furthermore by desensitization of T cells via the degradation product CXCL11(3-73).},

  abstract = {Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 is inactivated upon cleavage by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gelatinase A (MMP-2). We investigated the susceptibility to proteolytic processing of the 4 human MCPs by 8 recombinant MMPs to determine whether MCP-3 is an isolated example or represents a general susceptibility of chemokines to proteolytic inactivation by these important inflammatory proteases. In addition to MMP-2, MCP-3 is efficiently cleaved by membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, the cellular activator of MMP-2, and by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (MMP-1, MMP-13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Specificity was shown by absence of cleavage by matrilysin (MMP-7) and the leukocytic MMPs neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The closely related chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4 were not cleaved by MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, but were cleaved by MMP-1 and MMP-3 with varying efficiency. MCPs were typically cleaved between residues 4 and 5, but MCP-4 was further processed at Val7-Pro8. Synthetic MCP analogs corresponding to the MMP-cleaved forms bound CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 and CCR-3, but lacked chemoattractant activity in pre-B cells transfected with CCR-2 and CCR-3 or in THP-1 monocytic cells, a transformed leukemic cell line. Moreover, the truncated products of MCP-2 and MCP-4, like MCP-3, were potent antagonists of their cognate CC chemokine receptors in transwell cell migration assays in vitro. When they were injected 24 hours after the initiation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paws, their in vivo antagonist activities were revealed by a greater than 66% reduction in inflammatory edema progression after 12 hours. We propose that MMPs have an important role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses by processing chemokines in wound healing and in disease.},

  abstract = {Metformin is an effective hypoglycemic drug that lowers blood glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing glucose disposal in skeletal muscle; however, the molecular site of metformin action is not well understood. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity increases in response to depletion of cellular energy stores, and this enzyme has been implicated in the stimulation of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis. We recently reported that AMPK is activated by metformin in cultured rat hepatocytes, mediating the inhibitory effects of the drug on hepatic glucose production. In the present study, we evaluated whether therapeutic doses of metformin increase AMPK activity in vivo in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Metformin treatment for 10 weeks significantly increased AMPK alpha2 activity in the skeletal muscle, and this was associated with increased phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172 and decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2 activity. The increase in AMPK alpha2 activity was likely due to a change in muscle energy status because ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations were lower after metformin treatment. Metformin-induced increases in AMPK activity were associated with higher rates of glucose disposal and muscle glycogen concentrations. These findings suggest that the metabolic effects of metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes may be mediated by the activation of AMPK alpha2.},

DPP IV (EC 3.4.14.5) is a serine protease with a rare enzyme activity having an important role in the regulation of various processes, such as blood glucose control and immune responses. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel DPP IV-like molecule, termed dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 9 (DPP9). The deduced amino acid sequence of DPP9 has a serine protease motif, GWSYG, identical to that found in DPP IV. The presence of this motif, together with a conserved order and spacing of the Ser, Asp, and His residues that form the catalytic triad in DPP IV, places DPP9 in the DPP IV gene family. Northern blots showed that DPP9 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression levels in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, and the lowest in brain. In vitro translation of the cloned full-length DPP9 sequence resulted in a DPP9 protein product that migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at a position similar to the predicted protein size of 98 kDa. Consistent with the lack of predicted transmembrane domains and a signal sequence, DPP9 was found in a soluble, putative cytosolic form. A DPP9 orthologue in mice was identified by expressed sequence tag database searches and verified by cDNA cloning.},

  abstract = {Quantitative proteomics has traditionally been performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but recently, mass spectrometric methods based on stable isotope quantitation have shown great promise for the simultaneous and automated identification and quantitation of complex protein mixtures. Here we describe a method, termed SILAC, for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied. Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative proteomic approach in any cell culture system.},

  abstract = {Increasingly it is being recognized that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important processing enzymes that regulate cellular behaviour and immune cell function by selective proteolysis of cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules, cytokines and growth factors. These functions will likely prove to be as important in vivo as the proposed roles of MMPs in pathological matrix degradation. To screen for new protease substrates we have reported a novel 'exosite scanning' strategy that utilizes protease substrate-binding exosite domains as yeast two-hybrid baits. We discovered that the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) binds the hemopexin C domain of gelatinase A (MMP-2) leading to its efficient cleavage, converting an agonist to a potent receptor antagonist. We have now found that other MMPs cleave MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, SDF-lalpha and SDF-1beta indicating that the intersection between the chemokine and MMP families is broad with important implications for the control of inflammatory and immune processes. Use of engineered substrates with altered exosite binding affinities further revealed the power of exosites in dictating proteolytic specificity - either directing cleavage of non-preferred sites or in other cases virtually eliminating proteolysis of readily accessible scissile bonds. Hence, bioinformatic searches for protease substrates based on scissile bond preference will only reveal a subset of substrates unless the influence of exosites is considered.},

This group is unrelated to the classical trypsin and subtilisin families, and includes dipeptidyl peptidase IV, acylaminoacyl peptidase and oligopeptidase B, in addition to the prototype prolyl oligopeptidase. The recent crystal structure determination of prolyl oligopeptidase (80 kDa) has shown that the enzyme contains a peptidase domain with an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, and its catalytic triad is covered by the central tunnel of an unusual seven-bladed beta-propeller. This domain operates as a gating filter, excluding large, structured peptides from the active site. The binding mode of substrates and the catalytic mechanism differ from that of the classical serine peptidases in several features. The members of the family are important targets of drug design. Prolyl oligopeptidase is involved in amnesia, depression and blood pressure control, dipeptidyl peptidase IV in type 2 diabetes and oligopeptidase B in trypanosomiasis.},

CD26/DPPIV catalyzes cleavage of peptides from the amino terminus of peptides with proline at the penultimate position. Many biologically active peptides, such as beta-casomorphin1-5, contain proline in the penultimate position.

Fluorescent cresyl violet was generated by CD26/DPPIV-transfected Jurkat cells but not by wild-type Jurkat cells with a Km of 3.7 microM. beta-Casomorphin1-5 appeared to be a possible natural substrate of CD26/DPPIV, because it inhibited production of fluorescence competitively (Ki = 60 microM).

Abnormal expression is found in the case of autoimmune diseases, HIV-related diseases and cancer. Natural substrates for CD26/DPPIV are involved in immunomodulation, psycho/neuronal modulation and physiological processes in general. Therefore, targeting of CD26/ DPPIV and especially its proteolytic activity has many therapeutic potentials. On the other hand, there are homologous proteins with overlapping proteolytic activity, which thus may prevent specific modulation of CD26/DPPIV. In conclusion, CD26/DPPIV is a protein present both in various cellular compartments and extracellularly where it exerts different functions and thus is a true moonlighting protein.},

The crystal structure reveals a 2-2-2 symmetric tetrameric assembly which depends on the natively glycosylated beta-propeller blade IV. The crystal structure indicates that tetramerization of DP IV is a key mechanism to regulate its interaction with other components. Each subunit comprises two structural domains, the N-terminal eight-bladed beta-propeller with open Velcro topology and the C-terminal alpha/beta-hydrolase domain. Analogy with the structurally related POP and tricorn protease suggests that substrates access the buried active site through the beta-propeller tunnel while products leave the active site through a separate side exit. A dipeptide mimicking inhibitor complexed to the active site discloses key determinants for substrate recognition, including a Glu-Glu motif that distinguishes DP IV as an aminopeptidase and an oxyanion trap that binds and activates the P(2)-carbonyl oxygen necessary for efficient postproline cleavage.

We determined the crystal structure of human DPPIV at 2.6A resolution. The molecule consists of a unique eight-bladed beta-propeller domain in the N-terminal region and a serine protease domain in the C-terminal region. Also, the large cave structure, which is thought to control the access of the substrate, is found on the side of the beta-propeller fold. Comparison of the overall amino acid sequence between human DPPIV and POP shows low homology (12.9%).

  abstract = {Growth and metastasis of solid neoplasms require the recruitment of a supporting tumor stroma. A highly consistent trait of tumor stromal fibroblasts in most epithelial cancers is the induction of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a member of the serine protease family. Recently it was demonstrated that FAP has both dipeptidyl peptidase and collagenolytic activity capable of degrading gelatin and type I collagen. In this study, we describe the expression and enzyme activity of FAP in benign and malignant melanocytic skin tumors. FAP-positive fibroblasts were detected immunohistochemically in the reactive stroma of all melanocytic nevi tested. In primary and metastatic melanomas an upregulation of FAP expression in the reactive mesenchyme could be observed. Whereas 30% of the nevi revealed additional FAP expression on subsets of melanocytic cells, melanoma cells from primary and metastatic melanomas were FAP negative. This may indicate a possible role for FAP in the control of tumor cell growth and proliferation during melanoma carcinogenesis. Consistent with this in vivo expression pattern FAP enzyme activity could be detected by a specific immunocapture assay in extracts of melanocytic nevi and melanoma metastases, whereas no significant activity was detectable in normal adult skin. Strong protein expression of FAP was observed in patterned structures restricted to a subset of the melanoma metastases. Our findings that these FAP-positive structures showed no overlap with endothelial cell surface markers, nor with various melanoma antigens, suggest that FAP is a marker for specific stromal-cell-derived patterns in cutaneous melanoma metastases.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV/CD26 (DPP IV) is a cell-surface protease belonging to the prolyloligopeptidase family. It selectively removes the N-terminal dipeptide from peptides with proline or alanine in the second position. Apart from its catalytic activity, it interacts with several proteins, for instance, adenosine deaminase, the HIV gp120 protein, fibronectin, collagen, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. DPP IV is expressed on a specific set of T lymphocytes, where it is up-regulated after activation. It is also expressed in a variety of tissues, primarily on endothelial and epithelial cells. A soluble form is present in plasma and other body fluids. DPP IV has been proposed as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for various tumors, hematological malignancies, immunological, inflammatory, psychoneuroendocrine disorders, and viral infections. DPP IV truncates many bioactive peptides of medical importance. It plays a role in glucose homeostasis through proteolytic inactivation of the incretins. DPP IV inhibitors improve glucose tolerance and pancreatic islet cell function in animal models of type 2 diabetes and in diabetic patients. The role of DPP IV/ CD26 within the immune system is a combination of its exopeptidase activity and its interactions with different molecules. This enables DPP IV/CD26 to serve as a co-stimulatory molecule to influence T cell activity and to modulate chemotaxis. DPP IV is also implicated in HIV-1 entry, malignant transformation, and tumor invasion.},

  abstract = {Endomorphin-2 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-PheNH(2)) was discovered as an endogenous ligand for the mu-opioid receptor. The physiological function of endomorphin-2 as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator may cease through the rapid enzymatic process in the synapse of brain, as for other neuropeptides. The present study was conducted to examine the metabolism of endomorphin-2 by synaptic membranes prepared from mouse brain. Major metabolites were free tyrosine, free phenylalanine, Tyr-Pro and PheNH(2). Both the degradation of endomorphin-2 and the accumulation of major metabolites were inhibited by specific inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, such as diprotin A and B. On the other hand, the accumulation of Phe-PheNH(2) and Pro-Phe-PheNH(2) was increased in the presence of bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, whereas that of free phenylalanine and PheNH(2), was decreased. Furthermore, purified dipeptidyl peptidase IV hydrolyzed endomorphin-2 at the cleavage site, Pro(2)-Phe(3) bond. Thus, degradation of endomorphin-2 by brain synaptic membranes seems to take place mainly through the cleavage of Pro(2)-Phe(3) bond by dipeptidyl peptidase IV, followed by release of free phenylalanine and PheNH(2) from the liberated fragment, Phe-PheNH, by aminopeptidase. We have also examined that the effect of diprotin A on the antinociception induced by intracerebroventricularly administered endomorphin-2 in the mouse paw withdrawal test. Diprotin A simultaneously injected with endomorphin-2 enhanced endomorphin-2-induced antinociception. These results indicate that dipeptidyl peptidase IV may be an important peptidase responsible for terminating endomorphin-2-induced antinociception at the supraspinal level in mice.

In addition to protein identification a closer look at posttranslational modifications is now also possible. It is speculated that modifications like phosphorylation or glycosylation exist on every second protein and that they are important for the protein function.

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases. DPPIV removes dipeptides from the N terminus of substrates, including many chemokines, neuropeptides, and peptide hormones. Specific inhibition of DPPIV is being investigated in human trials for the treatment of type II diabetes. To understand better the molecular determinants that underlie enzyme catalysis and substrate specificity, we report the crystal structures of DPPIV in the free form and in complex with the first 10 residues of the physiological substrate, Neuropeptide Y (residues 1-10; tNPY). The crystal structure of the free form of the enzyme reveals two potential channels through which substrates could access the active site-a so-called propeller opening, and side opening. The crystal structure of the DPPIV/tNPY complex suggests that bioactive peptides utilize the side opening unique to DPPIV to access the active site. Other structural features in the active site such as the presence of a Glu motif, a well-defined hydrophobic S1 subsite, and minimal long-range interactions explain the substrate recognition and binding properties of DPPIV. Moreover, in the DPPIV/tNPY complex structure, the peptide is not cleaved but trapped in a tetrahedral intermediate that occurs during catalysis. Conformational changes of S630 and H740 between DPPIV in its free form and in complex with tNPY were observed and contribute to the stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate. Our results facilitate the design of potent, selective small molecule inhibitors of DPPIV that may yield compounds for the development of novel drugs to treat type II diabetes.},

A ubiquitous predominant DP9 mRNA transcript at 4.4 kb represented the short form, whereas a less abundant 5.0-kb transcript present predominantly in muscle represented the long form. Both forms of DP9 have no transmembrane domain and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. DP9 exhibited post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity and was a cytoplasmic, 110-kDa monomer. Thus, the six DPIV gene family members have diverse characteristics: only DP9 and DP8 have exclusively cytoplasmic localization and only DP9, DP8, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and DPIV have peptidase activity.},

DPP8 catalyzes the cleavage at the carboxyl side of the proline residue at the penultimate position. To study its structure and biochemical properties, we have overexpressed the human DPP8 protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells. The protein is soluble and can be purified to homogeneity. Using the chromogenic H-Gly-Pro-pNA as the substrate, a kinetic study shows that purified DPP8 is active and has a similar kcat value as that of DPP-IV, a prolyl dipeptidase that is a drug target for type II diabetes. The kinetic constants of DPP8 are also determined for other chromogenic substrates, and the results indicate that DPP8 has substrate preference at both the P1 and P2 sites. The expression system provides means of better understanding the structure, catalytic mechanism, and biological function of DPP8 protein.},

FAP is not expressed by mature somatic tissues except activated melanocytes and fibroblasts in wound healing or tumor stroma. FAP expression is specifically silenced in proliferating melanocytic cells during malignant transformation. To study the role of FAP as a tumor suppressor, the gene for mouse fap was cloned and mutated at the catalytic domain (FAP serine mutant, FSM). We found that expression of FAP or FSM at physiologic levels in mouse melanoma cells abrogated tumorigenicity. Remarkably, the mutant form FSM lacking specific serine protease activity was a more potent tumor suppressor. Tumor rejection was not due to adaptive immune responses because RAG1-/- mice challenged with melanoma cells expressing either FAP or FSM were not tumorigenic. In in vitro assays, FAP or FSM expression restored contact inhibition, led to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and increased susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis. Cell death in FAP+ or FSM+ melanoma cells was readily triggered by depletion of survival factors from the media, leading to subsequent activation of caspases via the intrinsic pathway. These results show that expression of FAP is a tumor suppressor that abrogates tumorigenicity through regulation of cell growth and survival.},

Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the extracellular domain of human DPPX determined at 3.0A resolution. This structure reveals the potential for a surface electrostatic change based on the protonation state of histidine. Subtle changes in extracellular pH might modulate the interaction of DPPX with Kv4.2 and possibly with other proteins. We propose models of DPPX interaction with the voltage-gated potassium channel complex. The dimeric structure of DPPX is highly homologous to the related protein DPP-IV. Comparison of the active sites of DPPX and DPP-IV reveals loss of the catalytic serine residue but the presence of an additional serine near the active site. However, the arrangement of residues is inconsistent with that of canonical serine proteases and DPPX is unlikely to function as a protease (dipeptidyl aminopeptidase).},

  abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Lung cancers produce a variety of mitogenic growth factors that stimulate tumor cell proliferation and migration. The cell surface protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), is involved in diverse biologic functions, including peptide-mediated cellular growth and differentiation. DPPIV is expressed in various normal tissues, including lung tissue, and its expression is lost in many types of human cancers. DPPIV expression and its enzymatic activity are detected in normal bronchial and alveolar epithelium but different histologic subtypes of lung carcinomas lose DPPIV expression. To investigate the role of DPPIV in lung carcinoma, we examined the expression of DPPIV at both mRNA and protein levels in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. DPPIV expression was detectable in normal lung epithelial cells, but was absent or markedly reduced in all NSCLC cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels. Restoration of DPPIV expression in NSCLC cells resulted in profound morphologic changes, inhibition of cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, in vitro cell migration and tumorigenicity in nude mice. DPPIV reexpression also correlated with increased p21 expression, leading to induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G1 stage. These effects were accompanied by increased expression of cell surface proteins, fibroblast-activating protein (Fapalpha) and CD44 that are associated with suppression of tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, DPPIV functions as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation may contribute to the loss of growth control in NSCLC cells.},

  abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPalpha) is highly expressed in epithelial cancers and has been implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, tumor growth, and metastasis. We present the first high resolution structure for the apoenzyme as well as kinetic data toward small dipeptide substrates. FAPalpha exhibits a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-like fold, featuring an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain and an eight-bladed beta-propeller domain. Known DPPIV dipeptides are cleaved by FAPalpha with an approximately 100-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency compared with DPPIV. Moreover, FAPalpha, but not DPPIV, possesses endopeptidase activity toward N-terminal benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-blocked peptides. Comparison of the crystal structures of FAPalpha and DPPIV revealed one major difference in the vicinity of the Glu motif (Glu(203)-Glu(204) for FAPalpha; Glu(205)-Glu(206) for DPPIV) within the active site of the enzyme. Ala(657) in FAPalpha, instead of Asp(663) as in DP-PIV, reduces the acidity in this pocket, and this change could explain the lower affinity for N-terminal amines by FAPalpha. This hypothesis was tested by kinetic analysis of the mutant FAPalpha/A657D, which shows on average an approximately 60-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency, as measured by k(cat)/K(m), for the cleavage of dipeptide substrates. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of the mutant is reduced by approximately 350-fold for cleavage of Z-Gly-Pro-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Our data provide a clear understanding of the molecular determinants responsible for the substrate specificity and endopeptidase activity of FAPalpha.},

PoPS specificity models can be used to predict and rank likely cleavages within a single substrate, and within entire proteomes. Other factors, such as the secondary or tertiary structure of the substrate, can be used to screen unlikely sites. Furthermore, the tool also provides facilities to infer, compare and test models, and to store them in a publicly accessible database.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a 110-kDa glycoprotein with ubiquitous expression. Several recent studies have shown that DPPIV affects tumor progression in several human malignancies. We found that ovarian carcinoma cell lines with higher DPPIV expression showed less invasive potential. Furthermore, introduction of DPPIV cDNA into SKOV3 cells (SKDPIV), derived from serous cystadenocarcinoma showing little DPPIV expression, caused a significant decrease in both migration and invasive potential. In addition, nude mice inoculated with SKDPIV cells showed significantly less peritoneal dissemination and longer survival time than those inoculated with parental or vector-transfected cells. We further examined the mechanisms of anti-invasive ability of DPPIV. The expression of E-cadherin was positively correlated with DPPIV expression among five independent ovarian carcinoma cell lines. The SKDPIV cells showed enhanced expression of E-cadherin with a cellular morphological change from a fibroblastic and motile phenotype to an epithelial phenotype compared to parental and MOCK cells. In addition, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and membrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP), which are important markers associated with invasive and metastatic potential, were remarkably reduced in SKDPIV cells. In contrast, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were enhanced by DPPIV transfection. These findings imply that DPPIV may functionally suppress peritoneal dissemination and progression of ovarian carcinoma by regulating the expression levels of several molecules associated with carcinoma cell invasion and progression.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV inhibitors are a new approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes. DPP-IV is a member of a family of serine peptidases that includes quiescent cell proline dipeptidase (QPP), DPP8, and DPP9; DPP-IV is a key regulator of incretin hormones, but the functions of other family members are unknown. To determine the importance of selective DPP-IV inhibition for the treatment of diabetes, we tested selective inhibitors of DPP-IV, DPP8/DPP9, or QPP in 2-week rat toxicity studies and in acute dog tolerability studies. In rats, the DPP8/9 inhibitor produced alopecia, thrombocytopenia, reticulocytopenia, enlarged spleen, multiorgan histopathological changes, and mortality. In dogs, the DPP8/9 inhibitor produced gastrointestinal toxicity. The QPP inhibitor produced reticulocytopenia in rats only, and no toxicities were noted in either species for the selective DPP-IV inhibitor. The DPP8/9 inhibitor was also shown to attenuate T-cell activation in human in vitro models; a selective DPP-IV inhibitor was inactive in these assays. Moreover, we found DPP-IV inhibitors that were previously reported to be active in models of immune function to be more potent inhibitors of DPP8/9. These results suggest that assessment of selectivity of potential clinical candidates may be important to an optimal safety profile for this new class of antihyperglycemic agents.},

  abstract = {Gangliosides play important biological roles and structural characterization of both the carbohydrate and the lipid moieties is important. The FT-ICR MS/MS techniques of electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron detachment dissociation (EDD), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) provide extensive fragmentation of the protonated and deprotonated GM1 ganglioside. ECD provides extensive structural information, including identification of both halves of the ceramide and cleavage of the acetyl moiety of the N-acetylated sugars. IRMPD provides similar glycan fragmentation but no cleavage of the acetyl moiety. Cleavage between the fatty acid and the long-chain base of the ceramide moiety is seen in negative-ion IRMPD but not in positive-ion IRMPD of GM1. Furthermore, this extent of fragmentation requires a range of laser powers, whereas all information is available from a single ECD experiment. However, stepwise fragmentation by IRMPD may be used to map the relative labilities for a series of cleavages. EDD provides the alternative of electron-induced fragmentation for negative ions with extensive fragmentation, but suffers from low efficiency as well as complication of data analysis by frequent loss of hydrogen atoms. We also show that analysis of MS/MS data for glycolipids is greatly simplified by classification of product ion masses to specific regions of the ganglioside based solely on mass defect graphical analysis.},

  abstract = {Injury and repair in chronic liver disease involve cell adhesion, migration, apoptosis, proliferation, and a wound healing response. In liver, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has both collagenase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) activities and is expressed only by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and myofibroblasts, which produce and degrade extracellular matrix (ECM). FAP was colocalized with collagen fibers, fibronectin, and collagen type I in human liver. FAP function was examined in vitro by expressing green fluorescent protein FAP fusion protein in cell lines cultured on collagen-I, fibronectin, and Matrigel. Glutamates at 203 and 204 as well as serine624 of FAP were essential for peptidase activity. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells overexpressing FAP showed reduced adhesion and migration. FAP overexpression in the human HSC line LX-2 caused increased cell adhesion and migration on ECM proteins as well as invasion across transwells in the absence or presence of transforming growth factor beta-1. FAP overexpression enhanced staurosporine streptomyces-stimulated apoptosis in both cell lines. Interestingly, the enzyme activity of FAP was not required for these functions. Overexpressing FAP increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and CD44 and reduced integrin-beta1 expression in 293T cells, suggesting potential pathways of FAP-mediated impairment of cell adhesion and migration in this epithelial cell line. In conclusion, these findings further support a pro-fibrogenic role for FAP by indicating that, in addition to its enzymatic functions, FAP has important nonenzymatic functions that in chronic liver injury may facilitate tissue remodeling through FAP-mediated enhancement of HSC cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis.},

In the present paper, we report the characterization of recombinant dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 using the baculovirus expression system. We have found that only the full-length variants of the two proteins can be expressed as active peptidases, which are 882 and 892 amino acids in length for dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and 9 respectively. We show further that the purified proteins are active dimers and that they show similar Michaelis-Menten kinetics and substrate specificity. Both cleave the peptide hormones glucagon-like peptide-1, glucagon-like peptide-2, neuropeptide Y and peptide YY with marked kinetic differences compared with dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidases IV, 8 and 9 using the well-known dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor valine pyrrolidide resulted in similar K(i) values, indicating that this inhibitor is non-selective for any of the three dipeptidyl peptidases.},

We describe, in addition, that living organisms can take advantage of the inherent ability of proteins to form such structures to generate novel and diverse biological functions. We review recent advances toward the elucidation of the structures of amyloid fibrils and the mechanisms of their formation at a molecular level. Finally, we discuss the relative importance of the common main-chain and side-chain interactions in determining the propensities of proteins to aggregate and describe some of the evidence that the oligomeric fibril precursors are the primary origins of pathological behavior.},

  abstract = {Sequence comparison is a major step in the prediction of protein structure from existing templates in the Protein Data Bank. The identification of potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling target sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment remain challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances have been in combining as many sources of information as possible - including amino acid variation in the form of profiles or hidden Markov models for both the target and template families, known and predicted secondary structures of the template and target, respectively the combination of structure alignment for distant homologues and sequence alignment for close homologues to build better profiles and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based on existing biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the problem including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold classification problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden Markov models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room for improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional progress may come from model building and refinement methods that can compensate for large structural changes between remotely related targets and templates, as well as for regions of misalignment. ¬© 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

To characterize FAP's P(4)-P(2)(') specificity, we synthesized intramolecularly quenched fluorescent substrate sets based on the FAP cleavage site in alpha(2)-antiplasmin (TSGP-NQ). FAP required substrates with Pro at P(1) and Gly or d-amino acids at P(2) and preferred small, uncharged amino acids at P(3), but tolerated most amino acids at P(4), P(1)(') and P(2)('). These substrate preferences allowed design of peptidyl-chloromethyl ketones that inhibited FAP, but not the related protease, dipeptidyl peptidase-4. Thus, FAP is a narrow specificity endopeptidase and this can be exploited for inhibitor design.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) is an alpha,beta-hydrolase-like serine exopeptidase, which removes dipeptides, preferentially with a C-terminal l-Pro residue, from the N terminus of longer peptide substrates. Previously, we determined the tetrameric 1.8A crystal structure of native porcine DPIV. Each monomer is composed of a beta-propeller and a catalytic domain, which together embrace an internal cavity housing the active centre. This cavity is connected to the bulk solvent by a propeller opening and a side opening. Here, we analyse DPIV complexes with a t-butyl-Gly-Pro-Ile tripeptide, Pro-boroPro, a piperazine purine compound, and aminoethyl phenyl sulfonylfluoride. The latter two compounds bind to the active-site groove in a compact and a quite bulky manner, respectively, causing considerable shifts of the catalytic Ser630 side-chain and of the Tyr547 phenolic group, which forms the oxyanion hole. The tripeptide, mimicking a peptide substrate, is clamped to the active site through tight interactions via its N-terminal alpha-ammonium group, the P2 carbonyl group, the P1-l-Pro side-chain, the C-terminal carboxylate group, and the stable orthoacid ester amide formed between the scissile peptide carbonyl group and Ser630 O(gamma). This stable trapping of the tripeptide could be due to stabilization of the protonated His740 imidazolium cation by the adjacent negatively charged C-terminal carboxylate group, preventing proton transfer to the leaving group nitrogen atom. Docking experiments with the compact rigid 58 residue protein aprotinin, which had been shown to be processed by DPIV, indicate that the Arg1-Pro2 N terminus can access the DPIV active site only upon widening of its side openings, probably by separation of the first and the last propeller blades, and/or of the catalytic and the propeller domain.},

  abstract = {Purpose of review: The current review focuses on recent studies, both clinical and from basic sciences, which approach possible pathomechanisms of critical illness myopathy in order to better derive potential clinical strategies for a preventive or curative clinical setting. Trends and concepts of clinical diagnosis and handling will be evaluated and their implications for muscle physiology and nutritional/metabolic intervention discussed. Recent findings: Conventional electrophysiology was combined with direct muscle stimulation to better differentiate critical illness myopathy from other neuromuscular disorders in critical illness. Muscle weakness was the result of impaired excitation--contraction-coupling at the level of the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Critical illness may alter sodium and ryanodine receptor calcium-release channels. Also, increased muscle proteolysis contributes to weakness in critical illness myopathy. Myosin loss is due to the risk factors systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis, steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents. Steroids can also induce necrosis and apoptosis in muscle. Inflammatory mediators aggravated muscle metabolic failure in critical illness myopathy. Ubiquitin--proteasome pathways, cyclooxygenase activation, altered glucose transporter expression, MyoD suppression, impaired respiratory chain enzymes, ATP depletion, glucose toxicity and insulin resistance can all contribute to the critical illness myopathy pathomechanism. Summary: The search for pathomechanisms is an important task for both clinical and basic sciences. Targets for treatment or prevention of critical illness myopathy include systemic inflammatory response, increased proteolysis and reduced antioxidative capacitance in critically ill patients.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4/CD26) and seprase/fibroblast activation protein alpha are homologous type II transmembrane, homodimeric glycoproteins that exhibit unique prolyl peptidase activities. Human DPP4 is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells and serves multiple functions in cleaving the penultimate positioned prolyl bonds at the NH(2) terminus of a variety of physiologically important peptides in the circulation. Recent studies showed a linkage between DPP4 and down-regulation of certain chemokines and mitogenic growth factors, and degradation of denatured collagens (gelatin), suggesting a role of DPP4 in the cell invasive phenotype. Here, we found the existence of a novel protease complex consisting of DPP4 and seprase in human endothelial cells that were activated to migrate and invade in the extracellular matrix in vitro. DPP4 and seprase were coexpressed with the three major protease systems (matrix metalloproteinase, plasminogen activator, and type II transmembrane serine protease) at the cell surface and organize as a complex at invadopodia-like protrusions. Both proteases were colocalized at the endothelial cells of capillaries, but not large blood vessels, in invasive breast ductal carcinoma in vivo. Importantly, monoclonal antibodies against the gelatin-binding domain of DPP4 blocked the local gelatin degradation by endothelial cells in the presence of the major metallo- and serine protease systems that modified pericellular collagenous matrices and subsequent cell migration and invasion. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism involving the DPP4 gelatin-binding domain of the DPP4-seprase complex that facilitates the local degradation of the extracellular matrix and the invasion of the endothelial cells into collagenous matrices.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD26 is a multifunctional cell surface glycoprotein expressed by T and B cells. It exhibits a dipeptidyl-peptidase activity (DPP-IV) that cleaves the penultimate proline from the N-terminus of polypeptides, thereby regulating their activity and concentration. METHODS: Using CD26-/- mice resulting from targeted inactivation of the gene, we examined the consequences of a DPP-IV defect on behavioural response to nociceptive stimuli and concentration of the pain modulator peptides substance P (SP) and endomorphin 2, two DPP-IV substrates. RESULTS: CD26 inactivation induced a three-fold decrease in circulating endopeptidase activity while that found in brain extracts was normal, albeit very weak. CD26-/- mice had high SP concentrations in plasma (3.4+/-1 pg/ml versus 1.5+/-0.3 pg/ml, P<10(-3)) but not in brain extracts (35+/-12 pg/ml versus 32+/-9 pg/ml, P>0.05). Endomorphin-2 levels in the two groups were in the same range for plasma and brain extracts. CD26-/- mice displayed short latencies to nociceptive stimuli (hot plate test: 6.6+/-1.2 s versus 8.6+/-1.5 s, P<10(-4); tail pinch test: 3.1+/-0.6 s versus 4.2+/-0.8 s, P<10(-3)). Administration of an SP (NK1) receptor antagonist or DPP-IV to CD26-/- mice normalised latencies. DPP-IV inhibitors decreased latencies only in CD26+/+ mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations represent the first fundamental evidence showing that DPP-IV influences pain perception via modulation of the peripheral SP concentration. Our work also highlights the role of peripheral NK1 receptors in nociception.},

  abstract = {The type-I and -II insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I, II) are now established as survival- or proliferation-factors in many in vitro systems. Of note IGFs provide trophic support for multiple cell types or organ cultures explanted from various species, and delay the onset of programmed cell death (apoptosis) through the mitochondrial (intrinsic pathway) or by antagonizing activation of cytotoxic cytokine signaling (extrinsic pathway). In some instances, IGFs protect against other forms of death such as necrosis or autophagy. The effect of IGFs on cell survival appears to be context specific, being determined both by the cell origin (tissue specific) and the cellular stress that induces loss of cellular viability. In many human cancers, there is a strong association with dysregulated IGF signaling, and this association has been extensively reviewed recently. IGF-regulation is also disrupted in childhood cancers as a consequence of chromosomal translocations. IGFs are implicated also in acute renal failure, traumatic injury to brain tissue, and cardiac disease. This article focuses on the role of IGFs and their cellular signaling pathways that provide survival signals in stressed cells.},

  abstract = {DPP8 belongs to the family of prolyl dipeptidases, which are capable of cleaving the peptide bond after a penultimate proline residue. Unlike DPP-IV, a drug target for type II diabetes, no information is available on the crystal structure of DPP8, the regulation of its enzymatic activity, or its substrate specificity. In this study, using analytical ultracentrifugation and native gel electrophoresis, we show that the DPP8 protein is predominantly dimeric when purified or in the cell extracts. Four conserved residues in the C-terminal loop of DPP8 (Phe(822), Val(833), Tyr(844), and His(859)), corresponding to those located at the dimer interface of DPP-IV, were individually mutated to Ala. Surprisingly, unlike DPP-IV, these single-site mutations abolished the enzymatic activity of DPP8 without disrupting its quaternary structure, indicating that dimerization itself is not sufficient for the optimal enzymatic activity of DPP8. Moreover, these mutations not only decreased k(cat), as did the corresponding DPP-IV mutations, but also dramatically increased K(m). We further show that the K(m) effect is independent of the substrate assayed. Finally, we identified the distinctive and strict substrate selectivity of DPP8 for hydrophobic or basic residues at the P2 site, which is in sharp contrast to the much less discriminative substrate specificity of DPP-IV. Our study has identified the residues absolutely required for the optimal activity of DPP8 and its unique substrate specificity. This study extends the functional importance of the C-terminal loop to the whole family of prolyl dipeptidases.},

The complex interplay of signal-transduction pathways further complicates the customization of cancer treatments to target single mechanisms.

Dipeptidyl peptidase IV and fibroblast activation protein are involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions and tissue remodeling. Fibroblast activation protein is upregulated and dipeptidyl peptidase IV is dysregulated in chronic liver disease. The effects of dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 on cell adhesion, cell migration, wound healing and apoptosis were measured by using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins to identify transfected cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase 9-overexpressing cells exhibited impaired cell adhesion, migration in transwells and monolayer wound healing on collagen I, fibronectin and Matrigel. Dipeptidyl peptidase 8-overexpressing cells exhibited impaired cell migration on collagen I and impaired wound healing on collagen I and fibronectin in comparison to the green fluorescent protein-transfected controls. Dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 enhanced induced apoptosis, and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 overexpression increased spontaneous apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that neither the catalytic serine of dipeptidyl peptidase 8 or dipeptidyl peptidase 9 nor the Arg-Gly-Asp integrin-binding motif in dipeptidyl peptidase 9 were required for the impairment of cell survival, cell adhesion or wound healing. We have previously shown that the in vitro roles of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and fibroblast activation protein in cell-extracellular matrix interactions and apoptosis are similarly independent of catalytic activity. Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 overexpression reduced beta-catenin, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and discoidin domain receptor 1 expression. This is the first demonstration that dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and thus may regulate tissue remodeling.},

  abstract = {This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating the synthesis, secretion, biological actions, and therapeutic relevance of the incretin peptides glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The published literature was reviewed, with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of GIP and GLP-1. GIP and GLP-1 are both secreted within minutes of nutrient ingestion and facilitate the rapid disposal of ingested nutrients. Both peptides share common actions on islet beta-cells acting through structurally distinct yet related receptors. Incretin-receptor activation leads to glucose-dependent insulin secretion, induction of beta-cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. GIP also promotes energy storage via direct actions on adipose tissue, and enhances bone formation via stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, GLP-1 exerts glucoregulatory actions via slowing of gastric emptying and glucose-dependent inhibition of glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also promotes satiety and sustained GLP-1-receptor activation is associated with weight loss in both preclinical and clinical studies. The rapid degradation of both GIP and GLP-1 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 has led to the development of degradation-resistant GLP-1-receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) safely without weight gain in subjects with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 and GIP integrate nutrient-derived signals to control food intake, energy absorption, and assimilation. Recently approved therapeutic agents based on potentiation of incretin action provide new physiologically based approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

  abstract = {The specificity of blood coagulation proteinases for substrate, inhibitor, and effector recognition is mediated by exosites on the surfaces of the catalytic domains, physically separated from the catalytic site. Some thrombin ligands bind specifically to either exosite I or II, while others engage both exosites. The involvement of different, overlapping constellations of exosite residues enables binding of structurally diverse ligands. The flexibility of the thrombin structure is central to the mechanism of complex formation and the specificity of exosite interactions. Encounter complex formation is driven by electrostatic ligand-exosite interactions, followed by conformational rearrangement to a stable complex. Exosites on some zymogens are in low affinity proexosite states and are expressed concomitant with catalytic site activation. The requirement for exosite expression controls the specificity of assembly of catalytic complexes on the coagulation pathway, such as the membrane-bound factor Xa*factor Va (prothrombinase) complex, and prevents premature assembly. Substrate recognition by prothrombinase involves a two-step mechanism with initial docking of prothrombin to exosites, followed by a conformational change to engage the FXa catalytic site. Prothrombin and its activation intermediates bind prothrombinase in two alternative conformations determined by the zymogen to proteinase transition that are hypothesized to involve prothrombin (pro)exosite I interactions with FVa, which underpin the sequential activation pathway. The role of exosites as the major source of substrate specificity has stimulated development of exosite-targeted anticoagulants for treatment of thrombosis.},

  abstract = {Regulator of chromatin condensation 1 (RCC1) is the only known guanine nucleotide-exchange factor for the Ran GTPase and has pivotal roles in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport, mitosis, and nuclear-envelope assembly. RCC1 associates dynamically with chromatin through binding to histones H2A and/or H2B in a Ran-regulated manner. Here, we report that, unexpectedly, the amino-terminal serine or proline residue of RCC1 is uniquely methylated on its alpha-amino group. Methylation requires removal of the initiating methionine, and the presence of proline and lysine at positions 3 and 4, respectively. Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 bind less effectively than wild-type protein to chromatin during mitosis, which causes spindle-pole defects. We propose a bimodal attachment mechanism for RCC1 in which the tail promotes stable RCC1 association with chromatin through DNA binding in an alpha-N-methylation-dependent manner. These data provide the first known function for N-terminal protein methylation.},

  abstract = {Pharmacology over the past 100 years has had a rich tradition of scientists with the ability to form qualitative or semi-quantitative relations between molecular structure and activity in cerebro. To test these hypotheses they have consistently used traditional pharmacology tools such as in vivo and in vitro models. Increasingly over the last decade however we have seen that computational (in silico) methods have been developed and applied to pharmacology hypothesis development and testing. These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling approaches, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer. In silico methods are primarily used alongside the generation of in vitro data both to create the model and to test it. Such models have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization. The aim of this review is to illustrate some of the in silico methods for pharmacology that are used in drug discovery. Further applications of these methods to specific targets and their limitations will be discussed in the second accompanying part of this review.},

  abstract = {N-terminal truncation of NPY has important physiological consequences, because the truncated peptides lose their capability to activate the Y1-receptor. The sources of N-terminally truncated NPY and related peptides are unknown and several proline specific peptidases may be involved. First, we therefore provide an overview on the peptidases, belonging to structural and functional homologues of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DP4) as well as aminopeptidase P (APP) and thus, represent potential candidates of NPY cleavage in vivo. Second, applying selective inhibitors against DP4, DP8/9 and DP2, respectively, the enzymatic distribution was analyzed in brain extracts from wild type and DP4 deficient F344 rat substrains and human plasma samples in activity studies as well as by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-mass spectrometry. Third, co-transfection of Cos-1 cells with Dpp4 and Npy followed by confocal lasermicroscopy illustrated that hNPY-dsRed1-N1 was transported in large dense core vesicles towards the membrane while rDP4-GFP-C1 was transported primarily in different vesicles thereby providing no clear evidence for co-localization of NPY and DP4. Nevertheless, the review and experimental results of activity and mass spectrometry studies support the notion that at least five peptidases (DP4, DP8, DP9, XPNPEP1, XPNPEP2) are potentially involved in NPY cleavage while the serine protease DP4 (CD26) could be the principal peptidase involved in the N-terminal truncation of NPY. However, DP8 and DP9 are also capable of cleaving NPY, whereas no cleavage could be demonstrated for DP2.},

Inhibitors of DPPs have an intriguing, therapeutic potential, with clinical efficacy seen in patients with diabetes. Until now, only recombinant forms of DPP8 and DPP9 have been characterized. Their enzymatic activities have not been demonstrated in or purified from any natural source. Using several selective DPP inhibitors, we show that DPP activity, attributable to DPP8/9 is present in human PBMC. All leukocyte types tested (lymphocytes, monocytes, Jurkat, and U937 cells) were shown to contain similar DPP8/9-specific activities, and DPPII- and DPPIV-specific activities varied considerably. The results were confirmed by DPPIV/CD26 immunocapture experiments. Subcellular fractionation localized the preponderance of DPP8/9 activity to the cytosol and DPPIV in the membrane fractions. Using Jurkat cell cytosol as a source, a 30-fold, enriched DPP preparation was obtained, which had enzymatic characteristics closely related to the ones of DPP8 and/or -9, including inhibition by allo-Ile-isoindoline and affinity for immobilized Lys-isoindoline.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DP4) inhibitors are currently under intensive investigation in late-stage clinical trials as a treatment for type II diabetes. Lack of selectivity toward the related enzymes DP8 and DP9 has recently emerged as a possible source of drug-induced toxicity. Unlike DP4, X-ray structures of DP8 and DP9 are not yet available. As an aid to understanding the structural basis for selectivity, the authors have constructed homology models of DP8 and DP9 based on the X-ray coordinates of DP4. Accurate sequence alignment reveals common structural features indicative for a well-preserved overall fold comprising two domains, namely, a hydrolase domain and a so-called beta-propeller, which together form the active site deeply buried within the protein. The conformation of two loops inside this deep cavity is particularly relevant for the active sites. The authors used a published protocol for loop prediction based on conformational sampling and energy analysis to generate plausible solutions for these two loops. The predictive power of the approach was successfully evaluated for the template protein DP4 and two additional known structures from the same protein family, namely, FAP and DPX. The authors also show that inclusion of the covalent ligand NVP-728 greatly enhances the refinement. Based on the established evaluation protocol, the corresponding loops of DP8 and DP9 were predicted and the resulting active sites were compared with DP4. In particular, the authors conclude that differences in the P2-pocket are relevant for the design of selective DP4 inhibitors. The loss of key interactions in DP8 and DP9 as predicted from their models is consistent with the selectivity profile of the DP4 clinical candidate MK-431.},

  abstract = {CD26 is a 110 kDa surface glycoprotein with intrinsic dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity that is expressed on numerous cell types and has a multitude of biological functions. An important aspect of CD26 biology is its peptidase activity and its functional and physical association with molecules with key roles in various cellular pathways and biological programs. CD26 role in immune regulation has been extensively characterized, with recent findings elucidating its linkage with signaling pathways and structures involved in T-lymphocyte activation as well as antigen presenting cell-T-cell interaction. Recent work also suggests that CD26 has a significant role in tumor biology, being both a marker of disease behavior clinically as well as playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis and development. In this paper, we will review emerging data that suggest CD26 may be an appropriate therapeutic target for the treatment of selected neoplasms and immune disorders. Through the use of various experimental approaches and agents to influence CD26/DPPIV expression and activity, such as anti-CD26 antibodies, CD26/DPPIV chemical inhibitors, siRNAs to inhibit CD26 expression, overexpressing CD26 transfectants and soluble CD26 molecules, our group has shown that CD26 interacts with structures with essential cellular functions. Its association with such key molecules as topoisomerase II alpha, p38 MAPK, and integrin PI, has important clinical implications, including its potential ability to regulate tumor sensitivity to selected chemotherapies and to influence tumor migration/metastases and tumorigenesis. Importantly, our recent in vitro and in vivo data support the hypothesis that CD26 may indeed be an appropriate target for therapy for selected cancers and immune disorders.},

The method takes advantage of specific N-terminal biotinylation of protein samples, followed by affinity enrichment and conventional LC (liquid chromatography)-MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) analysis. The method is simple, uses conventional and easily obtainable reagents, and is applicable to most proteomics facilities. As proof of principle, we demonstrate profiles of proteolytic events that reveal exquisite in vivo specificity of methionine aminopeptidase in E. coli and unexpected processing of mitochondrial transit peptides in yeast, mouse and human samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate how to rapidly distinguish real proteolysis that occurs in vivo from the predictions based on in vitro experiments.},

Although their physiological functions have been only partly elucidated, many of the KLKs appear to be useful prognostic cancer markers, showing distinct correlations between their expression levels and different stages of cancer. Recent advances in the purification of 'new type' recombinant KLKs allowed solution of the crystal structures of KLK4, KLK5, KLK6, and KLK7. Along with these data, enzyme kinetic studies and extended substrate specificity profiling have led to an understanding of the non-prime-side substrate preferences of KLK4, 5, 6, and 7. The shape and polarity of the specificity pockets S1-S4 explain well their substrate preferences. KLK4, 5, and 6 exhibit trypsin-like specificity, with a strong preference for Arg at the P1 position of substrates. In contrast, KLK7 displays a unique chymotrypsin-like specificity for Tyr, which is also preferred at P2. All four KLKs show little specificity for P3 residues and have a tendency to accept hydrophobic residues at P4. Interestingly, for KLK4, 5, and 7 extended charged surface regions were observed that most likely serve as exosites for physiological substrates.},

  abstract = {Post-translational modifications enable extra layers of control of the proteome, and perhaps the most important is proteolysis, a major irreversible modification affecting every protein. The intersection of the protease web with a proteome sculpts that proteome, dynamically modifying its state and function. Protease expression is distorted in cancer, so perturbing signaling pathways and the secretome of the tumor and reactive stromal cells. Indeed many cancer biomarkers are stable proteolytic fragments. It is crucial to determine which proteases contribute to the pathology versus their roles in homeostasis and in mitigating cancer. Thus the full substrate repertoire of a protease, termed the substrate degradome, must be deciphered to define protease function and to identify drug targets. Degradomics has been used to identify many substrates of matrix metalloproteinases that are important proteases in cancer. Here we review recent degradomics technologies that allow for the broadly applicable identification and quantification of proteases (the protease degradome) and their activity state, substrates, and interactors. Quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeling, such as ICAT, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), can reveal protease substrates by taking advantage of the natural compartmentalization of membrane proteins that are shed into the extracellular space. Identifying the actual cleavage sites in a complex proteome relies on positional proteomics and utilizes selection strategies to enrich for protease-generated neo-N termini of proteins. In so doing, important functional information is generated. Finally protease substrates and interactors can be identified by interactomics based on affinity purification of protease complexes using exosite scanning and inactive catalytic domain capture strategies followed by mass spectrometry analysis. At the global level, the N terminome analysis of whole communities of proteases in tissues and organs in vivo provides a full scale understanding of the protease web and the web-sculpted proteome, so defining metadegradomics.},

Proteolysis by Pm is necessary in several physiological and pathological processes requiring extracellular matrix degradation including cell migration, tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The binding of Pg to cell-surface receptors is regulated by two major structural features: L-lysine binding sites (LBS) and negatively charged sialic acid residues located on its carbohydrate chains. Pg uses its LBS to bind to a wide spectrum of cell-surface receptors whereas binding through its sialic acid residues is limited only to receptor proteins containing cationic pockets or lectin-like modules. In this review, we discuss both mechanisms, including the identification of DPP IV as a Pg receptor and the possible physiological role of Pg/Pm in complex with DPP IV and adenosine deaminase (ADA) and /or the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform NHE-3 in prostate cancer.},

Comprehensive characterization of protease signaling in complex biological samples is limited by available proteomic methods. We have developed a general approach for global identification of proteolytic cleavage sites using an engineered enzyme to selectively biotinylate free protein N termini for positive enrichment of corresponding N-terminal peptides. Using this method to study apoptosis, we have sequenced 333 caspase-like cleavage sites distributed among 292 protein substrates. These sites are generally not predicted by in vitro caspase substrate specificity but can be used to predict other physiological caspase cleavage sites. Structural bioinformatic studies show that caspase cleavage sites often appear in surface-accessible loops and even occasionally in helical regions. Strikingly, we also find that a disproportionate number of caspase substrates physically interact, suggesting that these dimeric proteases target protein complexes and networks to elicit apoptosis.},

  abstract = {The vast majority of the proteins encoded in any genome naturally undergo a large number of different N-terminal modifications, hindering their characterization by routine proteomic approaches. These modifications are often irreversible, usually cotranslational and are crucial, as their occurrence may reflect or affect the status, fate and function of the protein. For example, large signal peptide cleavages and N-blocking mechanisms reflect targeting to various cell compartments, whereas N-ligation events tend to be related to protein half-life. N-terminal positional proteomic strategies hold promise as a new generation of approaches to the fine analysis of such modifications. However, further biological investigation is required to resolve problems associated with particular low-abundance or challenging N-terminal modifications. Recent progress in genomics and bioinformatics has provided us with a means of assessing the impact of these modifications in proteomes. This review focuses on methods for characterizing the occurrence and diversity of N-terminal modifications and for assessing their contribution to function in complete proteomes. Progress is being made towards the annotation of databases containing information for complete proteomes, and should facilitate research into all areas of proteomics.},

Seprase has a dual function in tumour progression. The proteolytic activity of Seprase has been shown to promote cell invasiveness towards the ECM and also to support tumour growth and proliferation. Seprase appears to act as a proteolytically active 170-kDa dimer, consisting of two 97-kDa subunits. It is a member of the group type II integral serine proteases, which includes dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV/CD26) and related type II transmembrane prolyl serine peptidases, which exert their mechanisms of action on the cell surface. DPPIV and Seprase exhibit multiple functions due to their abilities to form complexes with each other and to interact with other membrane-associated molecules. Localisation of these protease complexes at cell surface protrusions, called invadopodia, may have a prominent role in processing soluble factors and in the degradation of extracellular matrix components that are essential to the cellular migration and matrix invasion that occur during tumour invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis.},

Furthermore, the gene of the structural homologous DP10 represents a susceptibility locus for asthma in humans, and the functional homologous DP8/9 are expressed in human leukocytes. Thus, although several mechanisms may account for a role of DP4-like peptidases in asthma, detailed information on their anatomical sites of expression and function in lungs is lacking. Therefore, bronchi and lung parenchyma were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and histochemical/enzymatic activity assays, as well as quantitative real-time PCR for this family of peptidases in naive and asthmatic rat lungs derived from wild-type F344 and DP4-deficient F344 rat strains. Surprisingly, results show not only that the induction of experimental asthma increases DP4 enzymatic activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and parenchyma, but also that DP8/9 enzymatic activity is regulated and, as well as the expression of DP10, primarily found in the bronchial epithelium of the airways. This is the first report showing a differential and site-specific DP4-like expression and function in the lungs, suggesting a pathophysiologically significant role in asthma.},

Crystal structures show that the soluble form of FAP comprises two domains, an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain and an 8-blade beta-propeller domain. The interface between these two domains forms the catalytic pocket, and an opening for substrate access to the internal active site. The FAP homodimer is structurally very similar to DPIV but FAP glycoprotein expression is largely confined to mesenchymal cells in diseased and damaged tissue, notably the tissue remodelling region in chronically injured liver. FAP peptide substrates include denatured collagen and alpha2-antiplasmin. The functional roles of FAP in tumors and fibrotic tissue are not fully understood.

  abstract = {Electron detachment dissociation (EDD) Fourier transform mass spectrometry has recently been shown to be a useful method for tandem mass spectrometry analysis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). EDD produces abundant glycosidic and cross-ring fragmentations that are useful for localizing sites of sulfation in GAG oligosaccharides. Although EDD fragmentation can be used to characterize GAGs in a single tandem mass spectrometry experiment, SO3 loss accompanies many peaks and complicates the resulting mass spectra. In this work we demonstrate the ability to significantly decrease SO3 loss by selection of the proper ionized state of GAG precursor ions. When the degree of ionization is greater than the number of sulfate groups in an oligosaccharide, a significant reduction in SO3 loss is observed in the EDD mass spectra. These data suggested that SO3 loss is reduced when an electron is detached from carboxylate groups instead of sulfate. Electron detachment occurs preferentially from carboxylate versus sulfate for thermodynamic reasons, provided that carboxylate is in its ionized state. Ionization of the carboxylate group is achieved by selecting the appropriate precursor ion charge state, or by the replacement of protons with sodium cations. Increasing the ionization state by sodium cation addition decreases, but does not eliminate, SO3 loss from infrared multiphoton dissociation of the same GAG precursor ions.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past, different research groups could show that treatment of immune cells with inhibitors of post-proline splitting dipeptidyl aminopeptidases leads to functional changes in the immune system consistent with immunosuppression. This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17, cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study.},

  abstract = {The mRNA expression pattern of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8 and DPP9, two DPP4 homologs, was studied previously and showed a broad tissue distribution. In this study, protein expression and activity of DPP8 and DPP9 were investigated in male reproductive tissues of different mammals. Based on specific DPP activities and inhibition profiles, the proline-selective DPP activity in the bovine and rat testis could predominantly be attributed to DPP8/9 and not to DPP4. This is in contrast to the epididymis, where most of the activity was caused by DPP4. Bovine sperm preparations had very low or undetectable DPP8/9 activity. After characterization of polyclonal antibodies specific for DPP8 or DPP9, we could localize both enzymes in seminiferous tubules of the testis. A specific staining for DPP9 was found associated with spermatozoids embedded in the epithelium, just before their release into the lumen, and in spermatids. DPP8 was localized in spermatozoids in an earlier stage of maturation. These findings help to provide insight into the physiological role of DPP4-like enzymes in the male reproductive system.

  abstract = {Protein degradation is an essential process that continuously takes place in all living cells. Regulated degradation of most cellular proteins is initiated by proteasomes, which produce peptides of varying length. These peptides are rapidly cleaved to single amino acids by cytoplasmic peptidases. Proline-containing peptides pose a specific problem due to structural constrains imposed by the pyrrolidine ring that prevents most peptidases from cleavage. Here we show that DPP9, a poorly characterized cytoplasmic prolyl-peptidase, is rate-limiting for destruction of proline-containing substrates both in cell extracts and in intact cells. We identified the first natural substrate for DPP9, the RU1(34-42) antigenic peptide (VPYGSFKHV). RU1(34-42) is degraded in vitro by DPP9, and down-regulation of DPP9 in intact cells results in increased presentation of this antigen. Together our findings demonstrate an important role for DPP9 in peptide turnover and antigen presentation.},

DPP-IV, originally described on the basis of its enzymatic activity, is a ubiquitous, multifunctional homodimeric plasma membrane glycoprotein of type II. Subsequently, several other molecules related to DPP-IV by their enzymatic activity and/or sequence were discovered and classified as dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity and/or structure homologues (DASH). Along with canonical DPP-IV this group comprises DPP-IVbeta, DPP-II, DPP6, DPP8, DPP9, DPP10 and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP-alpha). Recent observations of deregulated expression of several DASH molecules in multiple human cancers led to the assumptions of their pathogenetic relevance in cancerogenesis.

While DP8/9 biological functions are yet to be established, they have been predicted to have similar roles to the other DPs due to high sequence similarities within the active site of the enzymes. While there is mounting evidence towards the involvement of DP8 and/or DP9 in innate and acquired immunity, direct proof for the link between DP8 and DP9 and human disease is yet to be definitively shown, thus DP8 and 9 proteins remain guilty by association.},

  abstract = {Peptidases are enzymes that hydrolyse peptide bonds in proteins and peptides. Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as 'physiological' is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases.Database URL:http://merops.sanger.ac.uk.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV, CD26) and DP IV-like enzymes, such as dipeptidyl peptidase II (DP II), dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DP8), and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DP9), have been recognized to regulate T lymphocyte activation. Lys[Z(NO2)]-thiazolidide (LZNT) and Lys[Z(NO2)]-pyrrolidide (LZNP), non-selective inhibitors of DP IV-like activity known to target DP IV as well as DP II, DP8, and DP9, suppress T lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. Moreover, these inhibitors are capable of attenuating the severity of autoimmune diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the animal model of multiple sclerosis, and experimental arthritis, a model of human rheumatoid arthritis, in vivo, particularly in combination with inhibitors of aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) enzymatic activity. METHODS: Here, we studied the influence of non-selective and selective inhibitors of DP IV-like enzymes on DNA synthesis in mitogen-stimulated splenocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and DP IV/CD26-knockout (DP IV/CD26-KO) mice. RESULTS: LZNT and LZNP, the non-selective inhibitors of DP IV-like activity, suppressed the DNA synthesis in stimulated splenocytes from wild-type and DP IV/ CD26-KO mice to a comparable extent. Further, a selective inhibitor of DP8/DP9 activity was capable of suppressing DNA synthesis in mitogen-stimulated splenocytes of both wild-type and knockout mice to the same extent. In contrast, selective inhibitors of DP IV and DP II lacked this suppressive activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that DP8 and/or DP9 represent additional pharmacological targets for the suppression of T cell proliferation and for anti-inflammatory therapy.},

Moreover, the dimer interaction mode was investigated by introducing a mutation (F842A) at the dimer interface, which abolished the enzymatic activity without disrupting its quaternary structure. Furthermore, DPP9 was found ubiquitously expressed in fibroblasts, epithelial, and blood cells. Surprisingly, contrary to previous report, we found that the expression levels of DPP8 and DPP9 did not change upon the activation of the PBMC or Jurkat cells. These results indicate that the biochemical property of DPP9 is very similar to that of DPP8, its homologous protease.

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 is a member of the S9b serine protease family, which also includes DPP8 and DPP9. DPP4 cleaves a number of regulatory factors, including chemokines and growth factors. DPP4 inhibitors have recently emerged as an effective treatment option for type 2 diabetes. Early in vitro studies demonstrated that DPP4 inhibitors inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, leading to their investigation in numerous pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. Recent data suggest that the early DPP4-specific inhibitors might also bind DPP8 and DPP9, thus exerting their effects through non-specific binding. This review highlights recent insights into the applicability of DPP inhibitors as novel pharmacological agents for inflammatory disease.},

Recent reports indicate the presence of DP8 and DP9 in peripheral blood lymphocytes, testis, lung, and brain. For a more comprehensive understanding of DP8 and DP9 tissue and cellular expression, mRNA and enzyme activity were examined. Many organs from C57BL/6 wild-type and DPIV gene-knockout mice were examined; DP8/9 enzyme activity was detected in the immune system, brain, testis, muscle, and epithelia. In situ hybridization localized DP8 and DP9 mRNA to lymphocytes and epithelial cells in liver, gastrointestinal tract, lymph node, spleen, and lung. DP8 and DP9 mRNA was detected in baboon and mouse testis, and DP9 expression was elevated in human testicular cancers. DP8 and DP9 mRNA were ubiquitous in day 17 mouse embryo, with greatest expression in epithelium (skin and gastrointestinal tract) and brain. Thus, DP8 and DP9 are widely expressed enzymes. Their expression in lymphocytes and epithelia indicates potential for roles in the digestive and immune systems. This manuscript contains online supplemental material at http://www.jhc.org.

  abstract = {Although trypsin remains the most commonly used protease in MS, other proteases may be employed for increasing peptide coverage or generating overlapping peptides. Knowledge of the accurate specificity rules of these proteases is helpful for database search tools to detect peptides, and becomes crucial when label-free MS is used to discover in vivo proteolytic cleavages. Since in vivo cleavages are inferred by subtracting digestion-induced cleavages from all observed cleavages, it is important to ensure that the specificity rule used to identify digestion-induced cleavages are broad enough to capture even minor cleavages produced in digestion, to avoid erroneously identifying them as in vivo cleavages. In this study, we describe MS-Proteolysis, a software tool for identifying putative sites of in vivo proteolytic cleavage using label-free MS. The tool is used in conjunction with digestion by trypsin and three other proteases, whose specificity rules are revised and extended before inferring proteolytic cleavages. Finally, we show that comparative analysis of multiple proteases can be used to detect putative in vivo proteolytic sites on a proteome-wide scale.},

Our approach, named terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), addresses this challenge by using dendritic polyglycerol aldehyde polymers that remove tryptic and C-terminal peptides. We analyze unbound naturally acetylated, cyclized or labeled N-termini from proteins and their protease cleavage products by tandem mass spectrometry, and use peptide isotope quantification to discriminate between the substrates of the protease of interest and the products of background proteolysis. We identify 731 acetylated and 132 cyclized N-termini, and 288 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 cleavage sites in mouse fibroblast secretomes. We further demonstrate the potential of our strategy to link proteases with defined biological pathways in complex samples by analyzing mouse inflammatory bronchoalveolar fluid and showing that expression of the poorly defined breast cancer protease MMP-11 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells cleaves both endoplasmin and the immunomodulator and apoptosis inducer galectin-1.},

  abstract = {Functioning as an extracellular protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) preferentially cleaves the peptide bond after the penultimate proline residue. We report here that DPP-IV cleaves the first two amino acids from insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), revealed by mass spectrometry. The kinetic parameters of the proteolytic cleavage indicate that this reaction is physiologically relevant. Interestingly, truncated IGF-1 is less potent than the full-length protein in activating the IGF-1R, but binds more readily to IGF-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3). Quantitative RT-PCR showed that the level of DPP-IV mRNA is dramatically lower in lung squamous cell carcinoma tissues than in adjacent nonneoplastic lung tissues. However, this reduction was not observed in lung adenocarcinoma tissues. Our study suggests a possible link between IGF-1 and DPP-IV in cancer development in a specific tumor niche. A DPP-IV-related pathway may be important in mitigating IGF-1 signaling. Consequently, a robust IGF signaling pathway may accelerate early carcinogenesis in environments lacking DPP-IV.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since fibroblasts in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) express the serine proteases fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP-4)/CD26, we undertook the current study to determine the functional role of both enzymes in the invasion of RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) into articular cartilage. METHODS: Expression of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 by RASFs was analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunocytochemistry. Serine protease activity was measured by cleavage of fluorogenic substrates and inhibited upon treatment with L-glutamyl L-boroproline. The induction and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in RASFs were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Densitometric measurements of MMPs using immunoblotting confirmed our findings on the messenger RNA level. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 [CXCL12]), MMP-1, and MMP-3 protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The impact of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 inhibition on the invasiveness of RASFs was analyzed in the SCID mouse coimplantation model of RA using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Inhibition of serine protease activity of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 in vitro led to increased levels of SDF-1 in concert with MMP-1 and MMP-3, which are downstream effectors of SDF-1 signaling. Using the SCID mouse coimplantation model, inhibition of enzymatic activity in vivo significantly promoted invasion of xenotransplanted RASFs into cotransplanted human cartilage. Zones of cartilage resorption were infiltrated by FAP-expressing RASFs and marked by a significantly higher accumulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3, when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a central role for the serine protease activity of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 in protecting articular cartilage against invasion by synovial fibroblasts in RA.},

Structures of the homologs, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and DPIV, are known but the DP8 structure is yet to be resolved. To help characterise the DP8 substrate pocket, mutants of residues lining the pocket were produced at DP8(D772), DP8(Y315), DP8(H434) and DP8(D435) and assessed by substrate kinetics and size-exclusion chromatography. Mutations of DP8(D772A/E/S/V) affected catalysis but did not confer endopeptidase activity. Mutations of DP8(H434F), DP8(D435F) and DP8(Y315F) reduced catalytic activity. Furthermore, mutations to DP8(D772A/E/S/V), DP8(H434F), DP8(D435F) and DP8(Y315F) affected dimer stabilisation. Homology modelling of DP8 using DPIV and FAP crystal structures suggested that DP8(D772), DP8(H434) and DP8(D435) were located at the edge of the S2 catalytic pocket, contributing to the junction between the alpha-beta hydrolase and beta-propeller domains. This study provides insights into how the DP8 substrate pocket and dimer interface differ from DPIV and FAP which could be utilised for designing more selective DP8 inhibitors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although 25% to 44% of patients with heart failure (HF) have diabetes mellitus (DM), the optimal treatment regimen for HF patients with DM is uncertain. We investigated the association between metformin therapy and outcomes in a cohort of advanced, systolic HF patients with DM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with DM and advanced, systolic HF (n = 401) were followed at a single university HF center between 1994 and 2008. The cohort was divided into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of metformin therapy. The cohort had a mean age of 56 +/- 11 years, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 24 +/- 7%, with 42% being New York Heart Association (NYHA) III and 45% NYHA IV. Twenty-five percent (n = 99) were treated with metformin therapy. The groups treated and not treated with metformin were similar in terms of age, sex, baseline LVEF, medical history, and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin. Metformin-treated patients had a higher body mass index, lower creatinine, and were less often on insulin. One-year survival in metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated patients was 91% and 76%, respectively (RR = 0.37, CI 0.18-0.76, P = .007). After multivariate adjustment for demographics, cardiac function, renal function, and HF medications, metformin therapy was associated with a nonsignificant trend for improved survival. CONCLUSION: In patients with DM and advanced, systolic HF who are closely monitored, metformin therapy appears to be safe. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether metformin can improve HF outcome.},

Coordination of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis and cell signalling by uPAR underlies its important function in cell migration, proliferation and survival and makes it an attractive therapeutic target in cancer and inflammatory diseases. uPAR lacks transmembrane and intracellular domains and so requires transmembrane co-receptors for signalling. Integrins are essential uPAR signalling co-receptors and a second uPAR ligand, the ECM protein vitronectin, is also crucial for this process.},

  abstract = {Meningiomas are tumors derived from arachnoid cap cells that represent approximately 30% of all intracranial tumors. In this study, we investigated 22 human meningiomas for the expression of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV activity and/or structure homologs (DASH), including canonical DPP-IV/CD26, fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAPalpha), DPP8 and DPP9. DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity, including all enzymatically-active DASH molecules, was found in all 18 benign meningiomas WHO grade I and IV atypical meningiomas WHO grade II by continuous rate fluorimetric assay in tissue homogenates and catalytic enzyme histochemistry in situ. In atypical meningiomas, this activity was significantly higher and was associated with higher cell proliferation as detected by Ki67 antigen immunohistochemistry. The expression of DPP-IV/CD26 and FAPalpha demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry was low. As shown histochemically, it occurred most often on the surface of fibrous bundles and whorls rich in extracellular matrix. Compared to DPP-IV/CD26 and FAPalpha, the expression of DPP8 and DPP9 was higher and, in addition, it was present also in the cells inside these structures. Expression of CXCR4, the receptor of pro-proliferative chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), DPP-IV substrate, was found in all tumors, suggesting higher values in atypical grade II samples. This is the first report on the expression status of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV and related molecules in meningiomas. It shows that DPP8 and DPP9 prevail over canonical DPP-IV/CD26 and FAPalpha in all examined patients. In addition, the study suggests an increase of DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity in these tumors of WHO grade II.},

To further explore this concept we have characterized the expression of all DPIV-like enzymes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have demonstrated the constitutive expression of DPIV, DP8, DP9, DPII and PEP mRNA and DPIV, DP8 and DP9 protein in CLL. FAP mRNA was not detected in CLL or normal B-lymphocytes. This correlated with an absence of FAP protein on the cell surface. This study also shows that DP8 mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in CLL compared to normal tonsil B-lymphocytes (p < 0.05) which may suggest biological importance in this disease. DP expression could not be correlated with any molecular or clinical prognostic markers for CLL in this cohort including IgVH mutational status, CD38, ZAP-70 or CD49d expression (n = 58). However, the constitutive expression of the DPIV-like enzymes in CLL and their emergence as potent immune regulators makes them candidate therapeutic targets in this disease.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DP) activity partially attenuates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis in mice. The aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanisms of this protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wildtype (WT) and DPIV(-/-) mice consumed 2% DSS in drinking water for 6 days to induce colitis. Mice were treated with saline or the DP inhibitors Ile-Pyrr-(2-CN)*TFA or Ile-Thia. DP mRNA and enzyme levels were measured in the colon. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 and GLP-1 concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay, regulatory T-cells (Tregs) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on FOXp3+T cells in blood, and neutrophil infiltration assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. RESULTS: DP8 and DP2 mRNA levels were increased (P < 0.05) in WT+saline mice compared to untreated WT mice with colitis. Cytoplasmic DP enzyme activity was increased (P < 0.05) in DPIV(-/-) mice at day 6 of DSS, while DP2 activity was increased (P < 0.05) in WT mice with colitis. GLP-1 (63%) and GLP-2 (50%) concentrations increased in WT+Ile-Pyrr-(2-CN)*TFA mice compared to day-0 controls. MPO activity was lower in WT+Ile-Thia and WT+Ile-Pyrr-(2-CN)*TFA treated mice compared to WT+saline (P < 0.001) at day 6 colitis. CONCLUSIONS: DP expression and activity are differentially regulated during DSS colitis, suggesting a pathophysiological role for these enzymes in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DP inhibitors impaired neutrophil recruitment and maintenance of the Treg population during DSS-colitis, providing further preclinical evidence for the potential therapeutic use of these inhibitors in IBD. Finally, DPIV appears to play a critical role in mediating the protective effect of DP inhibitors.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the common coexistence of diabetes and heart failure (HF), the optimal medial treatment of diabetes in HF patients has not been well studied. We sought to compare the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in a cohort of ambulatory patients with diabetes and established HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using propensity score-matched samples, we examined the association between metformin use and the risk of death or risk of hospitalization in a national cohort of 6185 patients with HF and diabetes treated in ambulatory clinics at Veteran Affairs medical centers. In this cohort, 1561 (25.2%) patients were treated with metformin. At 2 years of follow-up, death occurred in 246 (15.8%) patients receiving metformin and in 1177 (25.5%) patients not receiving metformin (P<0.001). In the propensity score-matched analysis (n=2874), death occurred in 232 (16.1%) patients receiving metformin compared with 285 (19.8%) patients not receiving metformin (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.92; P<0.01). In propensity score-matched analyses, HF hospitalization or total hospitalization rates were not significantly different between individuals treated with metformin compared with those not treated with metformin (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.18; and hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin therapy was associated with lower rates of mortality in ambulatory patients with diabetes and HF. Future prospective studies are necessary to define the optimal therapy for diabetic patients with HF.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is widely considered to be associated with risk of pancreatic cancer (PaC), however, whether DM is a cause or a consequence of PaC is still controversial. We examined this association by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of cohort studies. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching Medline and Embase through November 30, 2010. Summary relative risks (RRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of thirty-five cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. DM was associated with an increased risk of PaC (the summary RRs=1.94; 95% CI, 1.66-2.27), with significant evidence of heterogeneity among these studies (p<0.001, I(2)=93.6%). Subgroup analyses revealed that the increased risk of PaC was independent of geographic locations, sex, study design, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI) and smoking status. In addition, the relative risk of PaC was correlated negatively with the duration of DM, with the highest risk of PaC found among patients diagnosed within less than 1 year. There was no significant publication bias (p=0.136 for Egger's regression asymmetry test). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this meta-analysis strongly support that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of PaC in both males and females and that DM is both an early manifestation and an etiologic factor of pancreatic cancer.},

  abstract = {Proteome identification using peptide-centric proteomics techniques is a routinely used analysis technique. One of the most powerful and popular methods for the identification of peptides from MS/MS spectra is protein database matching using search engines. Significance thresholding through false discovery rate (FDR) estimation by target/decoy searches is used to ensure the retention of predominantly confident assignments of MS/MS spectra to peptides. However, shortcomings have become apparent when such decoy searches are used to estimate the FDR. To study these shortcomings, we here introduce a novel kind of decoy database that contains isobaric mutated versions of the peptides that were identified in the original search. Because of the supervised way in which the entrapment sequences are generated, we call this a directed decoy database. Since the peptides found in our directed decoy database are thus specifically designed to look quite similar to the forward identifications, the limitations of the existing search algorithms in making correct calls in such strongly confusing situations can be analyzed. Interestingly, for the vast majority of confidently identified peptide identifications, a directed decoy peptide-to-spectrum match can be found that has a better or equal match score than the forward match score, highlighting an important issue in the interpretation of peptide identifications in present-day high-throughput proteomics.},

  abstract = {Proteolytic processing modifies the pleiotropic functions of many large, complex, and modular proteins and can generate cleavage products with new biological activity. The identification of exact proteolytic cleavage sites in the extracellular matrix laminins, fibronectin, and other extracellular matrix proteins is not only important for understanding protein turnover but is needed for the identification of new bioactive cleavage products. Several such products have recently been recognized that are suggested to play important cellular regulatory roles in processes, including angiogenesis. However, identifying multiple cleavage sites in extracellular matrix proteins and other large proteins is challenging as N-terminal Edman sequencing of multiple and often closely spaced cleavage fragments on SDS-PAGE gels is difficult, thus limiting throughput and coverage. We developed a new liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach we call amino-terminal oriented mass spectrometry of substrates (ATOMS) for the N-terminal identification of protein cleavage fragments in solution. ATOMS utilizes efficient and low cost dimethylation isotopic labeling of original N-terminal and proteolytically generated N termini of protein cleavage fragments followed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Being a peptide-centric approach, ATOMS is not dependent on the SDS-PAGE resolution limits for protein fragments of similar mass. We demonstrate that ATOMS reliably identifies multiple proteolytic sites per reaction in complex proteins. Fifty-five neutrophil elastase cleavage sites were identified in laminin-1 and fibronectin-1 with 34 more identified by matrix metalloproteinase cleavage. Hence, our degradomics approach offers a complimentary alternative to Edman sequencing with broad applicability in identifying N termini such as cleavage sites in complex high molecular weight extracellular matrix proteins after in vitro cleavage assays. ATOMS can therefore be useful in identifying new cleavage products of extracellular matrix proteins cleaved by proteases in pathology for bioactivity screening.},

  abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). To provide a quantitative assessment of the association between DM and risk of CRC, We evaluated the relation between DM and incidence and mortality of CRC in a systematic review of cohort studies. Full publications of cohort studies were identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index Expanded, through February 28, 2011. Summary relative risks (SRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized using a random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. A total of 41 cohort studies (35 articles) were included in this systematic review. Combining 30 cohort studies which presented results on diabetes and CRC incidence, diabetes was associated with an increased incidence of CRC (SRRs 1.27, 95% CI: 1.21-1.34), with evident heterogeneity among studies (P=0.002, I2=48.4%). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis by controlling the confounders showed that the increased incidence of CRC was independent of geographic locations, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking, physical activity and body mass index. Diabetes was also positively associated with CRC mortality (SRR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.40), with evidence of heterogeneity between studies (P<0.001, I2=81.4%). Results from this systematic review support that compared to non-diabetic individuals, diabetic individuals have an increased risk of CRC.},

  abstract = {Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) is a group of aggressive pediatric malignancies driven by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, an aberrant transcription factor up-regulating specific target genes, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 and Y5 receptors (Y5Rs). Previously, we have shown that both exogenous NPY and endogenous NPY stimulate ESFT cell death via its Y1 and Y5Rs. Here, we demonstrate that this effect is prevented by dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs), which cleave NPY to its shorter form, NPY(3-36), not active at Y1Rs. We have shown that NPY-induced cell death can be abolished by overexpression of DPPs and enhanced by their down-regulation. Both NPY treatment and DPP blockade activated the same cell death pathway mediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Moreover, the decrease in cell survival induced by DPP inhibition was blocked by Y1 and Y5R antagonists, confirming its dependence on endogenous NPY. Interestingly, similar levels of NPY-driven cell death were achieved by blocking membrane DPPIV and cytosolic DPP8 and DPP9. Thus, this is the first evidence of these intracellular DPPs cleaving releasable peptides, such as NPY, in live cells. In contrast, another membrane DPP, fibroblast activation protein (FAP), did not affect NPY actions. In conclusion, DPPs act as survival factors for ESFT cells and protect them from cell death induced by endogenous NPY. This is the first demonstration that intracellular DPPs are involved in regulation of ESFT growth and may become potential therapeutic targets for these tumors.},

  abstract = {Proteases have central roles in life and death processes due to their important ability to catalytically hydrolyze protein substrates, usually altering the function and/or activity of the target in the process. Knowledge of the substrate specificity of a protease should, in theory, dramatically improve the ability to predict target protein substrates. However, experimental identification and characterization of protease substrates is often difficult and time-consuming. Thus solving the substrate identification problem is fundamental to both understanding protease biology and the development of therapeutics that target specific protease-regulated pathways. In this context, bioinformatic prediction of protease substrates may provide useful and experimentally testable information about novel potential cleavage sites in candidate substrates. In this article, we provide an overview of recent advances in developing bioinformatic approaches for predicting protease substrate cleavage sites and identifying novel putative substrates. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the current methods and detail how more accurate models can be built by deriving multiple sequence and structural features of substrates. We also provide some suggestions about how future studies might further improve the accuracy of protease substrate specificity prediction.},

Because atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases are the major complications of diabetes, it is important to determine the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on atherosclerosis. In this study, nondiabetic and diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were treated with DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin for 24 weeks, and atherosclerotic lesions in aortic origins were examined. Results showed that diabetes significantly increased atherosclerotic lesions, but alogliptin treatment reduced atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic mice. Metabolic studies showed that diabetes increased plasma glucose and that alogliptin treatment reduced glucose. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry study showed that diabetes increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1beta protein expression in atherosclerotic plaques, but alogliptin treatment attenuated diabetes-augmented IL-6 and IL-1beta expression. In consistence with the observations from the mouse models, our in vitro studies showed that alogliptin-inhibited toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-mediated upregulation of IL-6, IL-1beta, and other proinflammatory cytokines by mononuclear cells. Taken together, our findings showed that alogliptin-inhibited atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and that the actions of alogliptin on both glucose and inflammation may contribute to the inhibition.},

  abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), DPP8, DPP9, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), the four proteases of the DPP4 gene family, have unique peptidase and extra-enzymatic activities that have been implicated in various diseases including cancers. We report here a novel role of DPP9 in regulating cell survival and proliferation through modulating molecular signaling cascades. Akt (protein kinase B) activation was significantly inhibited by human DPP9 overexpression in human hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Huh7) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) activity was unaffected, revealing a pathway-specific effect. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of DPP9 on Akt pathway activation was growth factor dependent. DPP9 overexpression caused apoptosis and significantly less epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated Akt activation in HepG2 cells. However, such inhibitory effect was not observed in cells stimulated with other growth factors, including connective tissue growth factor, hepatic growth factor, insulin or platelet-derived growth factor-BB. The effect of DPP9 on Akt did not occur when DPP9 enzyme activity was ablated by either mutagenesis or inhibition. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is a major downstream effector of Ras. We found that DPP9 and DPP8, but not DPP4 or FAP, associate with H-Ras, a key signal molecule of the EGF receptor signaling pathway. These findings suggest an important signaling role of DPP9 in the regulation of survival and proliferation pathways.},

However, it remains enormously challenging to simultaneously assess the intrinsic catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(M)) of these modifications in the context of their natural interactors. Such fundamental enzymological constants are key to determining substrate specificity and for establishing the timing and importance of cellular signaling. Here, we report the use of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for tracking proteolysis induced by human apoptotic caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 in lysates and living cells. By following the appearance of the cleaved peptides in lysate as a function of time, we were able to determine hundreds of catalytic efficiencies in parallel. Remarkably, we find the rates of substrate hydrolysis for individual caspases vary greater than 500-fold indicating a sequential process. Moreover, the rank-order of substrate cutting is similar in apoptotic cells, suggesting that cellular structures do not dramatically alter substrate accessibility. Comparisons of extrinsic (TRAIL) and intrinsic (staurosporine) inducers of apoptosis revealed similar substrate profiles, suggesting the final proteolytic demolitions proceed by similarly ordered plans. Certain biological processes were rapidly targeted by the caspases, including multiple components of the endocyotic pathway and miRNA processing machinery. We believe this massively parallel and quantitative label-free approach to obtaining basic enzymological constants will facilitate the study of proteolysis and other posttranslational modifications in complex mixtures.},

  abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inconsistent findings from observational studies have prolonged the controversy over the effects of history of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the risk of esophageal cancer (EC). We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies to evaluate the association of a history of DM with the risk of EC. METHODS: We identified studies by a literature search of MEDLINE (from 1 January 1966) and EMBASE (from 1 January 1974), through 28 Feburary 2011, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent articles. Summary relative risks (SRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies (6 case-control studies and 11 cohort studies) fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Compared with non-diabetic individuals, diabetic individuals had a modestly increased risk of EC (SRRs 1.30, 95% CI: 1.12-1.50), with significant heterogeneity among studies (p = 0.042). In stratified analysis, the SRRs of EC were 1.28 (1.10-1.49) for diabetic men and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.71-1.62) for diabetic women, respectively. In addition, DM was associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (SRR 2.12, 95% CI 1.01-4.46). There was no significant publication bias (p = 0.127 for Begg's adjusted rank correlation test and p = 0.629 for Egger's regression test). CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that men with diabetes may have a modestly increased risk of EC, while diabetic women were not the case.},

Currently, several methods are available to determine protease substrate specificity based on approaches employing proteinogenic amino acids. The knowledge about the specificity of proteases can be significantly extended by application of structurally diverse families of non-proteinogenic amino acids. From a chemical point of view, this information may be used to design specific substrates, inhibitors, or activity-based probes, while biological functions of proteases, such as posttranslational modifications can also be investigated. In this review, we discuss current and prospective technologies for application of non-proteinogenic amino acids in protease substrate specificity profiling.},

  abstract = {Metformin, one of most widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents, has recently received increased attention because of its potential antitumorigenic effects that are thought to be independent of its hypoglycemic effects. Several potential mechanisms have been suggested for the ability of metformin to suppress cancer growth in vitro and vivo: (1) activation of LKB1/AMPK pathway, (2) induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, (3) inhibition of protein synthesis, (4) reduction in circulating insulin levels, (5) inhibition of the unfolded protein response (UPR), (6) activation of the immune system, and (7) eradication of cancer stem cells. There is also a growing number of evidence, mostly in the form of retrospective clinical studies that suggest that metformin may be associated with a decreased risk of developing cancer and with a better response to chemotherapy. There are currently several ongoing randomized clinical trials that incorporate metformin as an adjuvant to classic chemotherapy and aim to evaluate its potential benefits in this setting. This review highlights basic aspects of the molecular biology of metformin and summarizes new advances in basic science as well as intriguing results from recent clinical studies.},

  abstract = {Proteinases play critical roles in both intra and extracellular processes by binding and cleaving their protein substrates. The cleavage can either be non-specific as part of degradation during protein catabolism or highly specific as part of proteolytic cascades and signal transduction events. Identification of these targets is extremely challenging. Current computational approaches for predicting cleavage sites are very limited since they mainly represent the amino acid sequences as patterns or frequency matrices. In this work, we developed a novel predictor based on Random Forest algorithm (RF) using maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method followed by incremental feature selection (IFS). The features of physicochemical/biochemical properties, sequence conservation, residual disorder, amino acid occurrence frequency, secondary structure and solvent accessibility were utilized to represent the peptides concerned. Here, we compared existing prediction tools which are available for predicting possible cleavage sites in candidate substrates with ours. It is shown that our method makes much more reliable predictions in terms of the overall prediction accuracy. In addition, this predictor allows the use of a wide range of proteinases.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time. METHODS: We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights. FINDINGS: Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2.503 billion) to 2010 (2.490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23% (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41% of global DALYs in 1990 to 25% in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80% of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47% of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43% from non-communicable diseases, and 10% from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35%, 54%, and 11%, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29%), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44% decline in DALYs), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19% increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51% decrease), and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351% increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37% increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34% increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions. INTERPRETATION: Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.},

  abstract = {CONTEXT: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The underlying mechanisms (incretin effect, beta-cell function, endogenous glucose production) are not well known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine mechanisms of the antihyperglycemic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We administered a mixed meal with glucose tracers ([6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose infused, [1-(2)H]-glucose ingested), and on a separate day, a glucose infusion matched the glucose responses to the meal (isoglycemic test) in 50 type 2 diabetes patients (hemoglobin A(1c) = 7.4 +/- 0.8%) and seven controls; 47 diabetic completers were restudied after 6 wk. Glucose fluxes were calculated, and beta-cell function was assessed by mathematical modeling. The incretin effect was calculated as the ratio of oral to iv insulin secretion. INTERVENTION: We conducted a 6-wk, double-blind, randomized treatment with sitagliptin (100 mg/d; n = 25) or placebo (n = 22). RESULTS: Relative to placebo, meal-induced changes in fasting glucose and glucose area under the curve (AUC) were greater with sitagliptin, in parallel with a lower appearance of oral glucose [difference (post-pre) AUC = -353 +/- 915 vs. +146 +/- 601 mumol . kg(-1) . 5 h] and greater suppression of endogenous glucose production. Insulin sensitivity improved 10%, whereas total insulin secretion was unchanged. During the meal, beta-cell glucose sensitivity improved (+19[29] vs. 5[21] pmol . min(-1) . m(-2) . mm(-1); median [interquartile range]) and glucagon AUC decreased (19.6 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 7.1 ng . ml(-1) . 5 h), whereas intact glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 AUC increased with sitagliptin vs. placebo. The incretin effect was unchanged because sitagliptin increased beta-cell glucose sensitivity also during the isoglycemic test. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic sitagliptin treatment improves glycemic control by lowering the appearance of oral glucose, postprandial endogenous glucose release, and glucagon response, and by improving insulin sensitivity and beta-cell glucose sensing in response to both oral and iv glucose.},

  abstract = {Drug discovery in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century has witnessed a myriad of changes that were adopted to predict whether a compound is likely to be successful, or conversely enable identification of molecules with liabilities as early as possible. These changes include integration of in silico strategies for lead design and optimization that perform complementary roles to that of the traditional in vitro and in vivo approaches. The in silico models are facilitated by the availability of large datasets associated with high-throughput screening, bioinformatics algorithms to mine and annotate the data from a target perspective, and chemoinformatics methods to integrate chemistry methods into lead design process. This chapter highlights the applications of some of these methods and their limitations. We hope this serves as an introduction to in silico drug discovery.},

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Accumulating evidence suggests that metformin has antitumor activity. The aim of this study was to determine whether metformin use has a survival benefit in patients with pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with diabetes and pancreatic cancer treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Information on diabetes history, including treatment modalities and clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer, was collected using personal interviews and medical record review. Survival analysis was carried out using a Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Among the 302 patients identified, there were no significant differences in demographic or major clinical characteristics between the patients who had received metformin (n = 117) and those who had not (n = 185). The 2-year survival rate was 30.1% for the metformin group and 15.4% for the non-metformin group (P = 0.004; chi(2) test). The median overall survival time was 15.2 months for the metformin group, and 11.1 months for the non-metformin group (P = 0.004, log-rank test). Metformin users had a 32% lower risk of death; the HR (95% confidence interval) was 0.68 (0.52-0.89) in a univariate model (P = 0.004), 0.64 (0.48-0.86) after adjusting for other clinical predictors (P = 0.003), and 0.62 (0.44-0.87) after excluding insulin users (P = 0.006). Metformin use was significantly associated with longer survival in patients with nonmetastatic disease only. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that metformin use was associated with improved outcome of patients with diabetes and pancreatic cancer should be confirmed in independent studies. Future research should prospectively evaluate metformin as a supplemental therapy in this population.},

Estimates are presented for selected chronic conditions and mental health characteristics, functional limitations, health status, health behaviors, health care access and utilization, and human immunodeficiency virus testing. Percentages and percent distributions are presented in both age-adjusted and unadjusted versions. DATA SOURCE: NHIS is a household, multistage probability sample survey conducted annually by interviewers of the U.S. Census Bureau for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. In 2010, data were collected on 27,157 adults in the Sample Adult questionnaire. The conditional response rate was 77.3%, and the final response rate was 60.8%. The health information for adults in this report was obtained from one randomly selected adult per family. In very rare instances where the sample adult was not able to respond for himself or herself, a proxy was used. HIGHLIGHTS: In 2010, 61% of adults aged 18 years and over had excellent or very good health. Twelve percent of adults had been told by a doctor or health professional that they had heart disease, 25% had been told on two or more visits that they had hypertension, 9% had been told they had diabetes, and 22% had been told they had some form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia. Twenty-one percent of adults were current smokers, and 21% were former smokers. Based on estimates of body mass index, 35% of adults were overweight and 27% were obese.},

  abstract = {The ability to catalytically cleave protein substrates after synthesis is fundamental for all forms of life. Accordingly, site-specific proteolysis is one of the most important post-translational modifications. The key to understanding the physiological role of a protease is to identify its natural substrate(s). Knowledge of the substrate specificity of a protease can dramatically improve our ability to predict its target protein substrates, but this information must be utilized in an effective manner in order to efficiently identify protein substrates by in silico approaches. To address this problem, we present PROSPER, an integrated feature-based server for in silico identification of protease substrates and their cleavage sites for twenty-four different proteases. PROSPER utilizes established specificity information for these proteases (derived from the MEROPS database) with a machine learning approach to predict protease cleavage sites by using different, but complementary sequence and structure characteristics. Features used by PROSPER include local amino acid sequence profile, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility and predicted native disorder. Thus, for proteases with known amino acid specificity, PROSPER provides a convenient, pre-prepared tool for use in identifying protein substrates for the enzymes. Systematic prediction analysis for the twenty-four proteases thus far included in the database revealed that the features we have included in the tool strongly improve performance in terms of cleavage site prediction, as evidenced by their contribution to performance improvement in terms of identifying known cleavage sites in substrates for these enzymes. In comparison with two state-of-the-art prediction tools, PoPS and SitePrediction, PROSPER achieves greater accuracy and coverage. To our knowledge, PROSPER is the first comprehensive server capable of predicting cleavage sites of multiple proteases within a single substrate sequence using machine learning techniques.

The impact that mass spectrometry-based proteomics has had on the field of biology has heavily depended on dramatic improvements in mass spectrometry that have been made in recent years. We examined 1541 reports indexed in PubMed relating to proteomics and reproduction to identify trends in the field and to make some broad observations for future work. To set the scene, in the first part of the report, we give a comprehensive overview of proteomics and associated techniques and technologies (such as separations and mass spectrometry). The second part examines the field in light of these techniques and suggests some opportunities for application of these tools in the area of reproduction.},

It is linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of death among adults in Western countries. Obese adipose tissue differs from lean adipose tissue in its immunogenic profile, body fat distribution and metabolic profile. Obese adipose tissue releases free fatty acids, adipokines and many pro-inflammatory chemokines. These factors are known to play a key role in regulating malignant transformation and cancer progression. Obese adipose tissue is infiltrated by macrophages that participate in inflammatory pathways activated within the tissue. Adipose tissue macrophages consist of two different phenotypes. M1 macrophages reside in obese adipose tissue and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2 macrophages reside in lean adipose tissue and produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10). The metabolic networks that confer tumour cells with their oncogenic properties, such as increased proliferation and the ability to avoid apoptosis are still not well understood. We review the interactions between adipocytes and immune cells that may alter the metabolism towards promotion of colorectal cancer.},

  abstract = {During inflammation, vascular permeability is increased by various proteolytic events, such as the generation of bradykinin, that augment local tissue responses by enabling tissue penetration of serum proteins, including complement and acute-phase proteins. Proteases also govern inflammatory responses by processing extracellular matrix proteins and soluble bioactive mediators. We quantified changes in the proteome and the nature of protein amino termini (the N-terminome) and the altered abundance of murine proteases and inhibitors during skin inflammation. Through analysis of the N-terminome by iTRAQ-TAILS, we identified cotranslational and posttranslational alphaN-acetylation motifs, quantitative increases in protein abundance, and qualitative changes in the proteolytic signature during inflammation. Of the proteins identified in normal skin, about half were cleaved, and phorbol ester-induced inflammation increased the proportion of cleaved proteins, including chemokines and complement proteins, that were processed at previously uncharacterized sites. In response to phorbol ester-induced inflammation, mice deficient in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) showed reduced accumulation of serum proteins in the skin and exhibited different proteolytic networks from those of wild-type mice. We found that the complement 1 (C1) inhibitor attenuated the increase in serum protein accumulation in inflamed skin. Cleavage and inactivation of the C1 inhibitor by MMP2 increased complement activation and bradykinin generation in wild-type mice, leading to increased vessel permeability during inflammation, which was diminished in Mmp2(-/-) mice. Thus, our systems-level analysis of proteolysis dissected cleavage events associated with skin inflammation and demonstrated that loss of a single protease could perturb the proteolytic signaling network and enhance inflammation.},

Metformin treatment is also associated with lower circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. To test whether Metformin directly affects ghrelin cells, rat primary stomach cells were treated with Metformin and the levels of ghrelin secretion, proghrelin gene expression and activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were examined. Metformin significantly reduced ghrelin secretion and proghrelin mRNA production and both these effects were blocked by co-incubation with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Furthermore, the AMPK activator 5-amino-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) significantly inhibited ghrelin secretion. Additionally, ghrelin cells were shown to express AMPK. Finally, Metformin treatment caused a significant increase in the level of phosphorylated (active) AMPK. Our results show that Metformin directly inhibits stomach ghrelin production and secretion through AMPK. This reduction in ghrelin secretion may be one of the key components in Metformin's mechanism of weight loss.},

In addition to its peptidase activity, DPP-4 is known to be associated with immune stimulation, binding to and degradation of extracellular matrix, resistance to anti-cancer agents, and lipid accumulation. The liver expresses DPP-4 to a high degree, and recent accumulating data suggest that DPP-4 is involved in the development of various chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis C virus infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, DPP-4 occurs in hepatic stem cells and plays a crucial role in hepatic regeneration. In this review, we described the tissue distribution and various biological effects of DPP-4.

  abstract = {Among the hundreds of posttranslational modifications, limited proteolysis, also known as processing, is special: It is irreversible, near ubiquitous, and by trimming peptide chains from their ends or cutting proteins into two, proteolysis forms shorter chains displaying new termini. The unique chemistry and location of alpha-amino-termini and carboxyl-termini in a protein engender special chemical and physical properties to a protein. Hence, modification of protein termini is often associated with new biological activities of a protein. We highlight recent proteomic developments enabling high throughput identification of protein termini. This has revolutionized degradomics and protein characterization by mapping the specificity of terminal modifications and of proteases, and has been used to directly identify new protease substrates and molecular pathways altered by proteolysis.},

  abstract = {Most human coronaviruses cause mild upper respiratory tract disease but may be associated with more severe pulmonary disease in immunocompromised individuals'. However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10% mortality and evidence of systemic spread(2). Recently, another coronavirus (human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection(3,4). Viral genome analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats'. Here we identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding Si domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells. Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may facilitate the development of intervention strategies.},

  abstract = {PTMs such as phosphorylation are often important actors in protein regulation and recognition. These functions require both visibility and accessibility to other proteins; that the modification is located at the surface of the protein. Currently, many repositories provide information on PTMs but structural information is often lacking. This study, which focuses on phosphorylation sites available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, illustrates that most phosphorylation sites are indeed found at the surface of the protein, but that some sites are found buried in the core of the protein. Several of these identified buried phosphorylation sites can easily become accessible upon small conformational changes while others would require the whole protein to unfold and are hence most unlikely modification sites. Subsequent analysis of phosphorylation sites available in PRIDE demonstrates that taking the structure of the protein into account would be a good guide in the identification of the actual phosphorylated positions in phophoproteomics experiments. This analysis illustrates that care must be taken when simply accepting the position of a PTM without first analyzing its position within the protein structure if the latter is available.},

To date, DP8 and DP9 have been implicated in immune responses and cancer biology, but their pathophysiological functions and substrate repertoire remain unknown. This study utilizes terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), an N-terminal positional proteomic approach, for the discovery of in vivo DP8 and DP9 substrates. In vivo roles for DP8 and DP9 in cellular metabolism and homeostasis were revealed via the identification of more than 29 candidate natural substrates and pathways affected by DP8/DP9 overexpression. Cleavage of 14 substrates was investigated in vitro; 9/14 substrates for both DP8 and DP9 were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, including two of high confidence, calreticulin and adenylate kinase 2. Adenylate kinase 2 plays key roles in cellular energy and nucleotide homeostasis. These results demonstrate remarkable in vivo substrate overlap between DP8/DP9, suggesting compensatory roles for these enzymes. This work provides the first global investigation into DP8 and DP9 substrates, providing a number of leads for future investigations into the biological roles and significance of DP8 and DP9 in human health and disease.},

In this article, we review three HUPO-PSI data standards - mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, which can be used to design a complete quantitative analysis pipeline in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the content of each data model, sufficient for bioinformaticians to devise proteomics software. We also provide guidance on the use of recently released application programming interfaces (APIs) developed in Java for each of these standards, which makes it straightforward to read and write files of any size. We have produced a set of example Java classes and a basic graphical user interface to demonstrate how to use the most important parts of the PSI standards, available from http://code.google.com/p/psi-standard-formats-tutorial.

In particular, the KEGG pathway maps are widely used for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. The link from genomes to pathways is made through the KEGG Orthology system, a collection of manually defined ortholog groups identified by K numbers. To better automate this interpretation process the KEGG modules defined by Boolean expressions of K numbers have been expanded and improved. Once genes in a genome are annotated with K numbers, the KEGG modules can be computationally evaluated revealing metabolic capacities and other phenotypic features. The reaction modules, which represent chemical units of reactions, have been used to analyze design principles of metabolic networks and also to improve the definition of K numbers and associated annotations. For translational bioinformatics, the KEGG MEDICUS resource has been developed by integrating drug labels (package inserts) used in society.},

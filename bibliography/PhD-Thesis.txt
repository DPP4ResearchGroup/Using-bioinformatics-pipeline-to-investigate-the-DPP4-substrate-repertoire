   number = {1615-9861 (Electronic)},
   abstract = {Over the last years, top-down (TD) MS has gained a remarkable space in proteomics, rapidly trespassing the limit between a promising approach and a solid, established technique. Several research groups worldwide have implemented TD analysis in their routine work on proteomics, deriving structural information on proteins with the level of accuracy that is impossible to achieve with classical bottom-up approaches. Complete maps of PTMs and assessment of single aminoacid polymorphisms are only a few of the results that can be obtained with this technique. Despite some existing technical and economical limitations, TD analysis is at present the most powerful instrument for MS-based proteomics and its implementation in routine workflow is a rapidly approaching turning point in proteomics. In this review article, the state-of-the-art of TD approach is described along with its major advantages and drawbacks and the most recent trends in TD analysis are discussed. References for all the covered topics are reported in the text, with the aim to support both newcomers and mass spectrometrists already introduced to TD proteomics. FAU - Armirotti, Andrea},

   abstract = {The Human Proteome Organisation — Proteomics Standards Initiative (HUPO-PSI) has been working for ten years on the development of standardised formats that facilitate data sharing and public database deposition. In this article, we review three HUPO-PSI data standards — mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, which can be used to design a complete quantitative analysis pipeline in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the content of each data model, sufficient for bioinformaticians to devise proteomics software. We also provide guidance on the use of recently released application programming interfaces (APIs) developed in Java for each of these standards, which makes it straightforward to read and write files of any size. We have produced a set of example Java classes and a basic graphical user interface to demonstrate how to use the most important parts of the PSI standards, available from http://code.google.com/p/psi-standard-formats-tutorial.

   abstract = {Data processing, management and visualization are central and critical components of a state of the art high-throughput mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics experiment, and are often some of the most time-consuming steps, especially for labs without much bioinformatics support. The growing interest in the field of proteomics has triggered an increase in the development of new software libraries, including freely available and open-source software. From database search analysis to post-processing of the identification results, even though the objectives of these libraries and packages can vary significantly, they usually share a number of features. Common use cases include the handling of protein and peptide sequences, the parsing of results from various proteomics search engines output files, and the visualization of MS-related information (including mass spectra and chromatograms). In this review, we provide an overview of the existing software libraries, open-source frameworks and also, we give information on some of the freely available applications which make use of them.

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV, an enzyme that releases dipeptides from substrates with N-terminal sequences of the forms X-Pro-Y or X-Ala-Y, was purified 300-fold from pig kidney cortex. The kidney is the main source of the enzyme, where it is one of the major microvillus-membrane proteins. Several other tissues contained demonstrable activity against the usual assay substrate glycylproline 2-naphthylamide. In the small intestine this activity was greatly enriched in the microvillus fraction. In all tissues examined, the activity was extremely sensitive to inhibition by di-isopropyl phosphorofluoridate (Dip-F), but relatively resistant to inhibition by phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride. It is a serine proteinase which may be covalently labelled with [32P]Dip-F, and is the only enzyme of this class in the microvillus membrane. The apparent subunit mol.wt. estimated by sodium dodecyl-sulphate/polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis and by titration with [32P]Dip-F was 130 000. Gel-filtration and sedimentation-equilibrium methods gave values in the region of 280 000, which is consistent with a dimeric structure, a conclusion supported by electron micrographs of the purified enzyme. Among other well-characterized serine proteinases, this enzyme is unique in its membrane location and its large subunit size. Investigation of the mode of attack of the peptidase on oligopeptides revealed that it could hydrolyse certain N-blocked peptides, e.g. Z-Gly-Pro-Leu-Gly-Pro. In this respect it is acting as an endopeptidase and as such may merit reclassification and renaming as microvillus-membrane serine peptidase. IMAGES:},

Detection limits, mass resolution and reproducibility were improved such that for many elements measurements could be extended down to the subppm range. For bulk analysis, a separate version of the LAMMA-instrument is under development. The examples of LAMMA-applications given in this paper include muscle tissue (physiological cations), uterine tissue (Fe), retina tissues (Na, Mgmg, K, Ca and Ba!), airborne particles (Pb, Fe, Al, Ti, Mn, Ca, Zn), cerebral tissue (Li), and pure cristalline organic materials.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.-) was solubilized from a particulate membrane fraction of rat intestinal mucosa with Triton X-100. The solubilized enzyme was purified to homogeneity following ammonium sulfate fractionation, chromatography on DEAE-Sepharose and hydroxyapatite, gel filtration and preparative polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The final enzyme preparation had a specific activity of 55 units/mg protein representing a 1373 fold purification over the starting material. Purity was judged by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and double immunodiffusion. The molecular weight of the native undenatured enzyme was estimated to be 230000 by gel filtration and polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Electrophoresis under denaturing conditions (sodium dodecyl sulfate) indicated that the protein consists of two identical 98 kDa subunits. Dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV is a glycoprotein containing approx. 8% carbohydrate by weight. A detailed analysis of the individual sugar components demonstrated that fucose, galactose, glucose, mannose, sialic acid and hexosamine sugars were present. The nature of the constituent asparagine linked oligosaccharide side chains was further examined following cleavage from the peptide backbone by hydrazinolysis. Following high voltage paper electrophoresis approx. 80% of the isolated oligosaccharide was found with the neutral fraction while the remaining 20% consisted of a single acidic component. Gel filtration of the neutral oligosaccharide fraction indicated that it contains approx. 19 sugar residues.},

   abstract = {Pig kidney microvillar proteins were extracted with octyl beta-glucoside and reconstituted in liposomes prepared from microvillar lipids of known composition. Four peptidases, namely endopeptidase (EC 3.4.24.11), aminopeptidases N (EC 3.4.11.2) and A (EC 3.4.11.7) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (EC 3.4.14.5), were shown to be reconstituted. At lipid/protein ratios greater than 4:1, about half the detergent-solubilized protein and nearly all of the activity of the four peptidases were reconstituted. Dissolution of the liposomes with Triton X-100 did not increase the activity of any of these peptidases, a result consistent with an asymmetric, 'right-side-out', orientation of these enzymes. When purified, endopeptidase was subjected to the same procedure; the two amphipathic forms of the enzyme (the detergent form and the trypsin-treated detergent form) were fully reconstituted. The amphiphilic form, purified after toluene/trypsin treatment, failed to reconstitute. Electron microscopy of microvilli showed that the appearance of the surface particles was profoundly altered by treatment with papain. Before treatment, the microvilli were coated with particles of stalk lengths ranging from 2.5 to 9 nm. After papain treatment nearly all the particles had stalks of 2-3 nm. Reconstituted microvillar proteins in liposomes showed the same heterogeneity of stalk length. In contrast, liposomes containing reconstituted endopeptidase revealed a very homogeneous population of particles of stalk length 2 nm. Since the smallest dimension of a papain molecule is 3.7 nm, the ability of papain, and other proteinases of similar molecular size, to release microvillar enzymes is crucially affected by the length of the junctional peptide that constitutes the stalk of this type of membrane protein.},

   abstract = {The effect of plasma on degradation of human growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH) was examined in vitro and in vivo using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), radioimmunoassay (RIA), and bioassay. When GRH(1-44)-NH2 was incubated with human plasma, the t1/2 of total GRH immunoreactivity was 63 min (RIA). However, HPLC revealed a more rapid disappearance (t1/2, 17 min) of GRH(1-44)-NH2 that was associated with the appearance of a less hydrophobic but relatively stable peptide that was fully immunoreactive. Sequence analysis indicated its structure to be GRH(3-44)-NH2. Identity was also confirmed by co-elution of purified and synthetic peptides on HPLC. Biologic activity of GRH(3-44)-NH2 was less than 10(-3) that of GRH(1-44)-NH2. After intravenous injection of GRH(1-44)-NH2 in normal subjects, a plasma immunoreactive peak with HPLC retention comparable to GRH(3-44)-NH2 was detected within 1 min and the t1/2 of GRH(1-44)-NH2 (HPLC) was 6.8 min. The results provide evidence for GRH inactivation by a plasma dipeptidylaminopeptidase that could limit its effect on the pituitary.},

In digestion mixtures without DP IV the yield of free amino acids was considerably lower than in the corresponding assays with this peptidase. Especially, the release of proline increases drastically from almost zero to the theoretical amount in the presence of DP IV. Quantitative results indicated that the specificities of the two microvillar peptidases (aminopeptidase M and DP IV) optimally complemented each other. This effect elucidates the hitherto obscure physiological role of intestinal DP IV. A similar effect may also apply to other caseins and nutritional proteins.},

   abstract = {Purified dipeptidyl peptidase IV from porcine pancreas or from human placenta cleaves N-terminal dipeptides from two proteins of the pancreatic juice, namely trypsinogen and pro-colipase. Phenylalanyl-proline is very effectively released (Km approximately 50 microM) from bovine or porcine trypsinogen. Both purified dipeptidyl peptidases also rapidly cleave valyl-proline from the N-terminus of porcine pro-colipase. This degradation does not increase the colipase activity of the precursor. However, under certain conditions, which are not fully understandable at present, dipeptidyl peptidase IV releases more slowly a second dipeptide, aspartyl-proline, from pro-colipase, and this results in a partial activation. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV apparently lines the excretory ducts of porcine pancreas and, therefore, is in close contact to the proteins of pancreatic juice in vivo. The possible significance of these degradations is discussed.},

About half known neuropeptide and peptide hormones have this unique chemical feature. Using a chemical detection method, a search for previously unknown peptides that possess the C-terminal amide structure in extracts of brain and intestine was carried out and a number of novel neuropeptides and hormonal peptides, designated neuropeptide Y, PHI, peptide YY, galanin and neuropeptide K were isolated. We recently performed a similar search in porcine pancreas and found a high concentration of a peptide having a glycine amide at its C-terminus. Here we report the isolation, primary structure and biological activity of this novel peptide. The 49-residue peptide strongly inhibits glucose-induced insulin release from the isolated perfused pancreas and was therefore named pancreastatin. It may be important in the regulation of insulin secretion and in the pathogenesis and treatment of diabetes mellitus.},

   abstract = {Since the description of the watery diarrhea syndrome by Verner and Morrison 29 years ago, clinical and experimental observations have elucidated the pathophysiology of this disease. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) is produced and released by a tumor of the pancreatic islets or by a tumor of neural crest origin such as a ganglioneuroma. Under normal conditions, current evidence suggests that VIP is a neurotransmitter in the central and peripheral nervous systems and particularly in the peptidergic nervous system. The low VIP plasma concentration observed in healthy subjects is viewed as a neuronal overflow since it has been impossible to ascertain any endocrine role for circulating VIP. Markedly elevated VIP plasma levels in the VIPoma syndrome lead to intestinal secretion with severe secretory diarrhea, resulting in hypovolemia, hypokalemia, and acidosis. These symptoms subside after successful tumor removal. Approximately 50 percent of patients have metastatic spread at the time of diagnosis. For these patients, a new and promising therapeutic modality is available in the form of a subcutaneously administered somatostatin analogue that relieves symptoms through potent inhibition of VIP release from tumor tissue.},

We purified the enzyme from 2-day-old rat cornified cells to homogeneity by Sephadex G-200 and Mono-Q column chromatography and finally HPLC gel filtration on G3000SW. The enzyme was estimated to be Mr 190,000 by HPLC gel filtration and Mr 90,000 by sodium dodecyl sulfate-electrophoresis. The enzyme showed general properties reported for detergent-solubilized DPP IV from other tissues. It was Con A binding and almost completely inhibited by 1 mM diisopropyl fluorophosphate and Diprotin A. The pI was 5.6 and the pH optimum was 7.5. The specific activity for Gly-Pro-p-nitroanilide was 31.9 units/mg. HPLC analysis demonstrated the release of dipeptides of the N-terminal of substance P, beta-casomorphin, and their related peptides. A stoichiometric reaction of the enzyme on substance P was observed. The epidermal DPP IV had a Km of 0.3 mM and a kcat of 50.3 s-1 for substance P and the Km value decreased by shortening the peptide from the carboxyl-terminal amino acids. The enzyme hydrolyzed human and bovine beta-casomorphin with Km values of 0.025 and 0.05 mM, respectively. Shortening the bovine beta-casomorphin peptide chain did not affect enzyme affinity.},

Two fractions (fractions I and II) showed kinin activity. Fraction I did not correspond to either bradykinin or other known kinins, whereas fraction II corresponded to bradykinin. Fraction I contained 8 amino acid residues from bradykinin minus 1 proline plus 1 additional hydroxyproline. Sequence analysis of fraction I showed that the proline at the third amino acid residue of bradykinin was replaced by hydroxyproline. The retention time of fraction I on reversed-phase HPLC was exactly the same as that of synthetic [hydroxyprolyl3]bradykinin (Arg-Pro-Hyp-Gly-Phe-Ser-Pro-Phe-Arg) and was distinguishable from des-Pro3-bradykinin.

   abstract = {The proteases involved in the maturation of regulatory peptides like those of broader specificity normally fail to cleave peptide bonds linked to the cyclic amino acid proline. This generates several mature peptides with N-terminal X-Pro-sequences. However, in certain non-mammalian tissues repetitive pre-sequences of this type are removed by specialized dipeptidyl (amino)peptidases during maturation. In mammals, proline-specific proteases are not involved in the biosynthesis of regulatory peptides, but due to their unique specificity they could play an important role in the degradation of them. Evidence exists that dipeptidyl (amino)peptidase IV at the cell surface of endothelial cells sequesters circulating peptide hormones which are then susceptible to broader aminopeptidase attack. The cleavage of several neuropeptides by prolyl endopeptidase has been demonstrated in vitro, but its role in the brain is questionable since the precise localization of the protease is not clarified.},

   abstract = {This review focusses on the behavioural effects of histamine and drugs which affect histaminergic function, particularly the H1- and H2-receptors antagonists. Research in this area has assumed considerable importance with increasing interest in the role of brain histamine, the clinical use of both H1 and H2 antagonists and evidence of nonmedical use of H1 antagonists. Results from a number of studies show that H1 and H2 antagonists have clear, but distinct subjective effects and that H1 antagonists have discriminative effects in animals. While H1 antagonists are reinforcers in certain conditions, histamine itself is a punisher. Moderate doses of H1 antagonists affect psychomotor performance in some situations, but the results are variable. The exceptions are terfenadine and astemizole, which do not seem to penetrate the blood-brain barrier readily. In studies of schedule-controlled behaviour, marked changes in response rate have been observed following administration of H1 antagonists, with the magnitude and direction dependent on the dose and the baseline behaviour. Histamine reduces avoidance responding, an effect mediated via H1-receptors. Changes in drinking and aggressive behaviour have also been observed following histamine administration and distinct roles for H1- and H2-receptors have been delineated. Separate H1- and H2-receptor mechanisms have also been suggested to account for changes in activity level. While the H2 antagonists do not always have strong behavioural effects when administered peripherally, there is evidence that cimetidine has a depressant effect on sexual function. These and other findings reveal an important role for histaminergic systems in a wide range of behaviour.},

   abstract = {Asparagine-linked sugar chains of rat kidney aminopeptidase N and dipeptidylpeptidase IV were investigated comparatively. Oligosaccharides released from the two enzymes by hydrazinolysis were fractionated by paper electrophoresis, serial chromatographies on columns of immobilized Aleuria aurantia lectin, concanavalin A, phytohemagglutinin E4, and Datura stramonium agglutinin, and Bio-Gel P-4 (less than 400 mesh) column chromatography. Structures of oligosaccharides in each fraction were assumed by their effective molecular sizes and behaviors on the four lectin columns and then confirmed by sequential exoglycosidase digestion and methylation analysis. The sugar chains of aminopeptidase N and dipeptidylpeptidase IV are almost the same as those of rat kidney gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase reported previously [Yamashita, K., Hitoi, A., Matsuda, Y., Tsuji, A., Katunuma, N., & Kobata, A. (1983) J. Biol. Chem. 258, 1098-1107]. They are a mixture of 5 high mannose type sugar chains and 32 (for aminopeptidase N) or 26 (for dipeptidylpeptidase IV) mono-, bi-, tri-, and tetraantennary complex type sugar chains. The unique feature of the complex-type sugar chains of both enzymes is that they all contain the bisecting N-acetylglucosamine residue and are incompletely galactosylated in their outer-chain moieties.},

   abstract = {The plasma enzyme responsible for primary proteolytic cleavage of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GRH) at the 2-3 amino acid bond was characterized. Native GRH[GRH(1-44)-NH2 and GRH(1-40)-OH], and COOH-terminally shortened fragments [GRH(1-32)-NH2 and GRH(1-29)-NH2] were rapidly cleaved, while GRH(2-32)-NH2 was not degraded at this site. Moreover, degradation to GRH(3-44)-NH2 was unaffected by an aminopeptidase inhibitor, indicating that this metabolite was generated from a single step cleavage by a dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP) rather than sequential aminopeptidase cleavages. Conversion to GRH(3-44)-NH2 was blocked by diprotin A, a DPP type IV (DPP IV) competitive inhibitor. D-Amino acid substitution at either position 1 or 2 also prevented hydrolysis, characteristic of DPP IV. Analysis of endogenous plasma GRH immunoreactivity from a human GRH transgenic pig revealed that the major peak coeluted with GRH(3-44)-NH2. Native GRH exhibited trypsin-like degradation at the 11-12 position but cleavage at the 12-13 site occurred only with GRH(1-32)-NH2 and GRH(1-29)-NH2. Formation of these metabolites was independent of prior DPP IV hydrolysis but was greatly reduced by trypsin inhibitors. Evaluation of plasma stability of potential GRH super analogues, designed to resist degradation by these enzymes, confirmed that GRH degradation in plasma occurs primarily by DPP IV, and to a lesser extent by trypsin-like enzyme(s).},

This dose caused a significant stimulation of basal gastric acid and potassium output. There were no significant changes in circulating gastrin throughout the infusion. In 2 subjects with a background of submaximal pentagastrin stimulation, PHV-42 infusion at the same dose did not alter acid secretion in either subject. The previous observation that PHV-42 is found particularly in the stomach and the new finding that it stimulates basal gastric secretion suggest the possibility that PHV-42 could have a role in local control of acid secretion.},

   abstract = {Pancreastatin is a 49-amino acid straight chain molecule isolated from porcine pancreatic extracts. In the perfused rat pancreas, this peptide has been shown to inhibit unstimulated insulin release and the insulin responses to glucose, arginine, and tolbutamide. To further explore the influence of pancreastatin on islet cell secretion, the effect of synthetic porcine pancreastatin (a 2-micrograms priming dose, followed by constant infusion at a concentration of 15.7 nmol/L) was studied on the insulin, glucagon, and somatostatin responses to 1 nmol/L vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), 1 nmol/L gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP), and 1 nmol/L 26 to 33 octapeptide form of cholecystokinin (8-CCK). The effect of pancreastatin on the insulin and somatostatin secretion elicited by glucagon (20 nmol/L) was also examined. Pancreastatin infusion consistently reduced the insulin responses to VIP, GIP, and 8-CCK without modifying glucagon or somatostatin release. It also inhibited the insulin release but not the somatostatin output induced by glucagon. These observations broaden the spectrum of pancreastatin as an inhibitor of insulin release. The finding that pancreastatin does not alter glucagon or somatostatin secretion supports the concept that it influences the B cell directly, and not through an A cell or D cell paracrine effect.},

   abstract = {We have recently developed a mAb, anti-1F7, which defines a family of structures found to include the molecule recognized by anti-Ta1 (CD26). In this paper, we demonstrated that binding of 1F7 by solid-phase immobilized anti-1F7 mAb but not anti-Ta1 mAb has a comitogenic effect by inducing proliferation of human CD4+ T lymphocytes in conjunction with submitogenic doses of anti-CD3 or anti-CD2. The proliferative response induced via the CD3-1F7 or CD2-1F7 pathways is associated with the IL-2 autocrine pathway, including IL-2 production. IL-2R expression and anti-IL-2R (Tac) inhibition. Furthermore, solid-phase immobilization of anti-1F7 but not anti-Ta1 acts in conjunction with submitogenic doses of PMA to mediate a comitogenic effect in the absence of anti-CD3 or anti-CD2, leading to CD4+ T cell proliferation. PMA treatment, in the meantime, leads to enhanced expression of 1F7 on the T cell surface. Despite its functional association with both pathways of activation, however, the 1F7 structure is not comodulated with the CD3/TCR complex nor the CD2 molecule. These findings thus suggest that the CD26 Ag is involved in CD3 and CD2-induced human CD4+ T cell activation.},

Differential plaque hybridization identified a cDNA, designated m119, that detected a 1.6-kilobase mRNA that accumulated in response to gamma-interferon (IFN-gamma) but not in response to other macrophage activators, including IFN-alpha, IFN-beta, and lipopolysaccharide. The mRNA encoded a predicted protein of Mr 14,461 containing a 21-amino acid signal peptide.

   abstract = {Stimulation of T lymphocytes through their antigen receptor (T-cell receptor; TCR) results in the activation of a tyrosine kinase and the generation of phosphatidyl inositol (PtdIns)-derived second messengers. Several reports have indicated that CD45, a haematopoietic cell-specific surface glycoprotein with tyrosine phosphatase activity in its cytoplasmic domain, is important in lymphocyte activation. To examine the possibility that CD45 might influence proximal signal transduction events through the TCR, we have isolated a variant of the human T-cell leukaemic line, HPB-ALL, which fails to express this phosphatase. Unlike cells expressing CD45, stimulation of the TCR in the CD45-negative cell does not result in PtdIns-derived second messengers. Reconstitution of CD45 expression restored early signalling events through the TCR. To localize the site of CD45 action, the human muscarinic type 1 receptor, which also activates the PtdIns second messenger pathway, was transfected into the CD45-negative cell. Although stimulation of the TCR failed to generate PtdIns-derived second messengers, there was normal activity of the PtdIns pathway when human muscarinic receptor type 1 was stimulated, despite the absence of CD45. These data indicate that CD45 influences a cellular component that is essential for effective coupling of the TCR to the PtdIns second messenger pathway.},

   abstract = {The cytosolic free calcium concentration, [Ca2+]i in phagocytic cells (e.g. neutrophils, human leukemic cell line HL-60) is an important determinant of cellular activity. In resting phagocytes [Ca2+]i is low (approximately 100 nM), but in response to occupation of cell surface receptors, it rises to micromolar levels, thereby activating a variety of cellular functions. The increases in [Ca2+]i consist of two components: an immediate that is independent of extracellular Ca2+, and a more delayed that is abolished by the removal of extracellular Ca2+. These two components reflect the involvement of two subcellular structures in intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis: an intracellular Ca2+ store, referred to as the calciosome; and the plasma membrane. The function of the intracellular Ca2(+)-store depends on a Ca2(+)-pump, functionally and immunologically related to the cardiac sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca2(+)-ATPase, a Ca2(+)-storage protein, similar to muscle calsequestrin, and a Ca2(+)-release channel, which is sensitive to inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. The Ca2(+)-regulatory function of the plasma membrane depends on a Ca2+ pump, similar to the erythrocyte-type Ca2(+)-ATPase, and a Ca2+ channel; the activity of the Ca2+ channel is closely coupled to phosphatidylinositol turnover.},

Kinetic constants were determined for the degradation of a number of other natural peptides, including substance P, the degradation of which has been described earlier in a qualitative manner. Generally, small peptides are degraded much more rapidly than proteins. However, the Km-values seem to be independent of the peptide chain length.

This particular rat strain genetically lacks dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Owing to the absence of this enzyme, the tripeptide was found to be completely resistant to hydrolysis by the renal brush-border membrane vesicles. Uptake of the tripeptide into these membrane vesicles in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ gradient was slightly greater than in the presence of a K+ gradient, but there was no evidence for active transport. On the contrary, uptake was very rapid in the presence of an inside-alkaline transmembrane pH gradient, and accumulation of the tripeptide inside the vesicles against a concentration gradient could be demonstrated under these conditions. The uptake was drastically reduced by dissipation of the pH gradient. The uptake was stimulated by an inside-negative membrane potential and inhibited by an inside-positive membrane potential. Moreover, the uptake was greater in voltage-clamped membrane vesicles than in control vesicles. Many di- and tripeptides inhibited this pH gradient-stimulated uptake of Phe-Pro-Ala. The apparent dissociation constant for the tripeptide was 48 microM. High performance liquid chromatography analysis of the intravesicular content at the peak of the overshoot revealed that the tripeptide was transported across the membrane almost entirely in the intact form. These data provide the first direct evidence for the presence of an electrogenic tripeptide-proton symport in renal brush-border membranes.},

In order to delineate the mechanism of the transport of an intact tripeptide across the brush-border membrane, we studied the characteristics of the uptake of [3H]Phe-Pro-Ala in membrane vesicles in which the activity of dipeptidylpeptidase IV was completely inhibited by treatment with di-isopropyl fluorophosphate. In these vesicles, uptake of radiolabel from the tripeptide was found to be Na(+)-independent, but was greatly stimulated by an inwardly directed H+ gradient. The H(+)-gradient-dependent radiolabel uptake appeared to be an active process, because the time course of uptake exhibited an overshoot phenomenon. The process was also electrogenic, being stimulated by an inside-negative membrane potential. Under the uptake-measurement conditions there was no detectable hydrolysis of [3H]Phe-Pro-Ala in the incubation medium when di-isopropyl fluorophosphate-treated membrane vesicles were used. Analysis of intravesicular contents revealed that the radiolabel inside the vesicles was predominantly (greater than 90%) in the form of intact tripeptide. These data indicate that the uptake of radiolabel from [3H]Phe-Pro-Ala in the presence of an inwardly directed H+ gradient represents almost exclusively uptake of intact tripeptide. Uphill transport of the tripeptide was also demonstrable in the presence of an inwardly directed Na+ or K+ gradient, but only if nigericin was added to the medium. Under these conditions, nigericin, an ionophore for Na+, K+ and H+, was expected to generate a transmembrane H+ gradient. Uptake of Phe-Pro-Ala in the presence of a H+ gradient was inhibited by di- and tri-peptides, but not by free amino acids. It is concluded that tripeptide/H+ co-transport is the mechanism of Phe-Pro-Ala uptake in rabbit renal brush-border membrane vesicles.},

   abstract = {In this investigation, we have demonstrated that the renal brush-border membrane of Fischer 344 rats from the Japanese Charles River Inc. specifically lacks dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) activity, whereas the renal brush-border membrane of Fischer 344 rats from three different sources within the United States possesses normal levels of DPP IV activity. Comparison of the brush-border proteins between Charles River (U.S.A.) Fischer 344 rats (DPP IV positive) and Japanese Charles River Fischer 344 rats (DPP IV negative) revealed that a protein band (Mr = 100,000), apparently identical with DPP IV, was absent in the membranes from Japanese Charles River Fischer 344 rats. We examined the handling of radiolabeled beta-casomorphin fragment 1-5 (Tyr-Pro-[3H]Phe-Pro-Gly), a specific substrate for DPP IV, in renal brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from DPP IV-positive and DPP IV-negative rats. Although the membrane vesicles from DPP IV-positive rats were able to hydrolyze the pentapeptide to di- and tripeptides with the subsequent active transport of these products via the H+ gradient-dependent peptide transport system, the membrane vesicles from DPP IV-negative rats failed to hydrolyze the pentapeptide and hence lacked the ability to transport the radiolabel actively from the parent peptide. The H+ gradient-dependent glycyl-sarcosine uptake and the Na+ gradient-dependent proline uptake, however, were normal in DPP IV-negative rats. Urine analysis revealed that the DPP IV-negative rats excreted proline- and hydroxyproline-containing peptides in significantly increased amounts in their urine compared with control rats. Furthermore, following intravenous administration of Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-NH2, a peptide that is exclusively hydrolyzed by DPP IV, urinary excretion of the peptide in the intact form was many-fold greater in DPP IV-negative rats than in control rats. These data provide conclusive evidence for the obligatory role of DPP IV in the renal handling of proline (and hydroxyproline)-containing peptides.},

   abstract = {The natriuretic peptides are hormones that can stimulate natriuretic, diuretic, and vasorelaxant activity in vivo, presumably through the activation of two known cell surface receptor guanylyl cyclases (ANPR-A and ANPR-B). Although atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and, to a lesser extent, brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) are efficient activators of the ANPR-A guanylyl cyclase, neither hormone can significantly stimulate ANPR-B. A member of this hormone family, C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), potently and selectively activated the human ANPR-B guanylyl cyclase. CNP does not increase guanosine 3',5'-monophosphate accumulation in cells expressing human ANPR-A. The affinity of CNP for ANPR-B is 50- or 500-fold higher than ANP or BNP, respectively. This ligand-receptor pair may be involved in the regulation of fluid homeostasis by the central nervous system.},

   abstract = {Recent studies have demonstrated that Fischer-344 rats from Japanese Charles River Inc. specifically lack dipeptidyl(amino)peptidase IV (DAP IV-negative; EC 3.4.14.5), whereas Fischer-344 rats from sources within the United States (DAP IV-positive) possess normal DAP IV activity. In the present study, plasma from DAP IV-positive rats metabolized substance P (SP) (5.37 +/- 0.25 nmol/min/ml) via the actions of angiotensin-converting enzyme (EC 3.4.15.1) (1.86 +/- 0.50 nmol/min/ml) and DAP IV (2.56 +/- 0.42 nmol/min/ml). DAP IV sequentially converted SP to SP[3-11] and SP[5-11]. The SP[5-11] metabolite was then rapidly hydrolyzed by plasma aminopeptidase M (AmM; EC 3.4.11.2) (36.2 +/- 4.2 nmol/min/ml). In contrast, SP metabolism by plasma from DAP IV-negative rats was less than half that of control animals (2.14 +/- 0.06 nmol/min/ml), due to a complete lack of DAP IV hydrolysis. The absence of DAP IV was not associated with any differences in angiotensin-converting enzyme-mediated hydrolysis of SP (1.45 +/- 0.11 nmol/min/ml) or AmM-mediated hydrolysis of SP[5-11] (37.1 +/- 0.9 nmol/min/ml). Consistent with this deficiency in SP metabolism, SP was more potent in vivo in stimulating salivary secretion in DAP IV-negative rats compared to DAP IV-positive animals. Potentiation was specific in that SP[5-11], an SP fragment resistant to DAP IV, was equipotent in DAP IV-negative and positive animals. SP[5-11]-induced salivary secretion was potentiated in both strains when AmM-mediated hydrolysis was inhibited by amastatin (20 nmol/min, i.v.). These data provide direct evidence for a significant role for DAP IV and AmM in the in vivo processing of SP and active SP metabolites.},

   abstract = {Oligopeptidases are endopeptidases that are not proteinases in the strict sense, since they do not hydrolyse peptide bonds in proteins, but act only on smaller polypeptides or oligopeptides. These enzymes apparently perform important, specialized biological functions that include the modification or destruction of peptide messenger molecules. Oligopeptidases have few naturally occurring inhibitors, and their distinctive specificity prevents them from interacting with alpha 2-macroglobulin, unlike the great majority of endopeptidases. The specificity of these specialized endopeptidases doubtless depends upon the three-dimensional structure of the active site, but no crystallographic structure is yet available for an oligopeptidase. Study of the primary structure of prolyl oligopeptidase has recently shown that it is a member of a new family of serine-type peptidases most of which are exopeptidases. The alignment of the sequences leads to the identification of some catalytic triad residues that have not yet been elucidated experimentally.},

   abstract = {The kinetics and selectivity of proteolysis of synthetic human growth hormone-releasing factor and analogs by purified human placental dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) were studied by HPLC. The initial rates of Ala2-Asp3 cleavage (pH 7.8, 37 degrees C, So = 0.15 mM) were all approx. 5 mumol min-1 mg-1 for the parent hormone, GRF(1-44)-NH2, and the fragments, GRF(1-29)-NH2 and GRF(1-20)-NH2. Lower activities observed for GRF(1-11)-OH, GRF(1-3)-OH, and cyclic lactam analogs indicate S1'-Sn' binding. Assays of [Trp6]-GRF(1-29)-NH2 versus [D-Trp6]-GFR(1-29)-NH2 indicate an S4' binding cavity. Peptides with D-configuration at P2, P1 or P1' and desNH2Tyr1 and N-MeTyr1 analogs of GRF were not cleaved. Catalytic parameters for the P1-substituted analogs [X2,Ala15]-GRF(1-29)-NH2 were found to vary with X as follows, Km: Abu less than Ala less than Pro less than Val less than Ser less than Gly much less than Leu; kcat: Pro greater than Ala greater than Abu greater than Ser greater than Gly much greater than Leu greater than Val; kcat/Km: Abu greater than Pro greater than Ala much greater than Ser greater than Gly = Val much greater than Leu. Km is at a minimum and kcat/Km at a maximum, for a hydrophobic P1 side-chain of about 0.25 nm in length, i.e., the ethyl side-chain of alpha-aminobutyric acid (Abu) is very close to optimal. These results further define the S1 selectivity of DPP IV and may be useful in the design of DPP IV resistant GRF analogs that can be produced by recombinant DNA methods and the design of DPP IV inhibitors.},

   abstract = {Clinical and veterinary uses of growth hormone-releasing factor [GRF(1- 29)NH2] require the design of analogs that are resistant to proteolysis by serum and liver degrading enzymes. This study investigated rat GRF(1-29)NH2 processing in serum and liver homogenate by means of high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Synthetic rGRF(1-29)NH2 (30 microM) was incubated (0-120 min, 37 degrees C) in serum (49 +/- 8 mg prot./ml). The rGRF(1-29)NH2 (10 microM) was also incubated (0-120 min, 37 degrees C) with liver homogenate (200 +/- 6 micrograms prot./ml). Time course studies of rGRF(1-29)NH2 disappearance showed apparent half-lives of 18 +/- 4 min and 13 +/- 3 min in serum and liver homogenate, respectively. This was accompanied by the appearance of degradation products that were all less hydrophobic than the native peptide. In the serum, two major metabolites were detected and isolated by preparative HPLC. Combined results of amino acid analysis, sequencing, and chromatography with synthetic homologs revealed the presence of rGRF(1-20)OH and (3-20)OH. A small amount of rGRF(12-29)NH2, coeluting with rGRF(3-20)OH, was also found by sequencing. In the liver, rGRF(1-18)OH, (3-18)OH, and (1-10)OH were identified. The peptide bond Ala2-Asp3 (DPP IV cleavage site) was hydrolyzed in both serum and liver. Other tissue-specific cleavage sites were Arg11-Arg12 and Arg20-Lys21 (trypsin-like cleavage site) in the serum, and Tyr10-Arg11 and Tyr18-Ala19 (chymotrypsin-like cleavage site) in the liver.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Intradermal injectionof β-casomorphine-7 induced a wheal and flare reaction in the skin similarto histamine or codeine. Oral pretreatment with the H<sub>1</sub> antagonist terfenadine significantly inhibited the skin responses to β-casomorphine-7. The intradermal injection of an opiate receptor antagonist, naloxone, inhibited in vitro histamine release and skin reactions only in a 100-fold excess over β-casomorphine-7. These findings suggest that β-casomorphine-7 can be regarded as a noncytotoxic, direct histamine releaser in humans. The clinical relevance of these findings deserves further studies.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The contribution made by different enzymes to the degradation of bradykinin in physiological conditions was estimated by examining bradykinin metabolism in rat serum, in the in situ perfused lung and in vivo. METHODS: Dose-response curves for the hypotensive effect of intra-arterially and intravenously injected bradykinin were obtained in unanaesthetized rats. High-performance liquid chromatography was used to analyse the products of bradykinin breakdown after incubation with rat serum and perfusion through in situ lung preparations. RESULTS: In rat serum, kininase I degraded 34% and kininase II 11% of bradykinin, no evidence for other activities being detected. In the awake rat, D,L-2-mercaptomethyl-3-guanidino-ethylthiopropionic acid, an inhibitor of kininase I, did not reduce the percentage of bradykinin inactivation in the pulmonary circulation. In the in situ perfused lung 65% of bradykinin was metabolized and the main products were BK1-7, BK1-5 and BK4-9. Enalaprilat (an inhibitor of kininase II) blocked the formation of BK1-7 and BK1-5 and increased the recovery of BK4-9. beta-Mercapto-ethanol, which inhibits aminopeptidase P, and diprotin A, a specific inhibitor of dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV, both reduced the formation of BK4-9. Diprotin A also allowed the recovery of BK2-9. Bradykinin degradation and BK4-9 recovery were not affected by endopeptidase inhibitors. CONCLUSIONS: Our results show that the main degradation pathway of bradykinin in the lung is through the action of kininase II at the carboxyl terminus, and sequential cleavage by aminopeptidase P followed by dipeptidylaminopeptidase IV at the amino terminus. The amino-terminal degradation of bradykinin represents about 38% of the total lung kininase activity.},

   abstract = {Two receptor subtypes, Y1 and Y2, are known to mediate PYY biological activity. PYY 1-36 binds to Y1 and Y2 receptors with equal affinity, whereas the second endogenous form of PYY, PYY 3-36, selectively binds to Y2 receptors. Dipeptidyl cleavage thus transforms an unselective Y agonist into a highly selective Y2 agonist, PYY 3-36. The enzyme responsible for this processing is unknown. Since PYY has a proline in the penultimate position it is protected from the attack of most unspecific exopeptidases. Only a few exopeptidases are theoretically capable of generating PYY 3-36 from PYY 1-36. Of the enzymes tested only the dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPP IV, E.C. 3.4.14.5) cleaved Tyr-Pro from PYY 1-36 with high activity. Since DPP IV is found on the endothelial surface and brush border membranes it can be considered a candidate enzyme for generating PYY 3-36 in vivo, thereby regulating the ratio of Y1/Y2 receptor stimulation by PYY.},

   abstract = {Neuropeptide Y, peptide YY and pancreatic polypeptide share an evolutionary conserved proline-rich N-terminal sequence, a structure generally known to be inert to the attack of common proteinases, but a potential target for specialized proline-specific aminopeptidases. Purified human dipeptidyl peptidase IV (also termed CD 26) liberated N-terminal Tyr-Pro from both, neuropeptide Y and peptide YY, with very high specific activities and Km values in the micromolar range, but almost no Ala-Pro from pancreatic polypeptide. Other proline-specific aminopeptidases exhibited low (aminopeptidase P, liberation of N-terminal Tyr) or totally no activity (dipeptidyl peptidase II), as was also observed with less-specific aminopeptidases (aminopeptidase M, leucine aminopeptidase). When human serum was incubated with neuropeptide Y or peptide YY at micro- and nanomolar concentrations, Tyr-Pro was detected as a metabolite of both peptides. Formation of Tyr-Pro in serum was blocked in the presence of Lys-pyrrolidine and diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile), specific, competitive inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Incubation of neuropeptide Y or peptide YY with immunocytochemically defined, cultivated endothelial cells from human umbilical cord also yielded Tyr-Pro. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV could be immunostained on most endothelial cells by a specific antibody. We suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase IV might be involved in the degradation of neuropeptide Y and peptide YY to N-terminal truncated neuropeptide Y(3-36) and peptide YY(3-36). Since specific binding to Y1, but not to Y2 subtype of neuropeptide Y/peptide YY receptors requires intact N- as well as C-termini of neuropeptide Y and peptide YY, removal of their amino-terminal dipeptides by dipeptidyl peptidase IV inactivates them for binding to one receptor subtype.},

   abstract = {Peptides of the glucagon/vasoactive-intestinal-peptide (VIP) peptide family share a considerable sequence similarity at their N-terminus. They either start with Tyr-Ala, His-Ala or His-Ser which might be in part potential targets for dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, a highly specialized aminopeptidase removing dipeptides only from peptides with N-terminal penultimate proline or alanine. Growth-hormone-releasing factor (1-29)amide and gastric inhibitory peptide/glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) with terminal Tyr-Ala as well as glucagon-like peptide-1(7-36)amide/insulinotropin [GLP-1(7-36)amide] and peptide histidine methionine (PHM) with terminal His-Ala were hydrolysed to their des-Xaa-Ala derivatives by dipeptidyl-peptidase IV purified from human placenta. VIP with terminal His-Ser was not significantly degraded by the peptidase. The kinetics of the hydrolysis of GIP, GLP-1(7-36)amide and PHM were analyzed in detail. For these peptides Km values of 4-34 microM and Vmax values of 0.6-3.8 mumol.min-1.mg protein-1 were determined for the purified peptidase which should allow their enzymic degradation also at physiological, nanomolar concentrations. When human serum was incubated with GIP or GLP-1(7-36)amide the same fragments as with the purified dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, namely the des-Xaa-Ala peptides and Tyr-Ala in the case of GIP or His-Ala in the case of GLP-1(7-36)amide, were identified as the main degradation products of these peptide hormones. Incorporation of inhibitors specific for dipeptidyl-peptidase IV, 1 mM Lys-pyrrolidide or 0.1 mM diprotin A (Ile-Pro-Ile), completely abolished the production of these fragments by serum. It is concluded that dipeptidyl-peptidase IV initiates the metabolism of GIP and GLP-1(7-36)amide in human serum. Since an intact N-terminus is obligate for the biological activity of the members of the glucagon/VIP peptide family [e. g. GIP(3-42) is known to be inactive to release insulin in the presence of glucose as does intact GIP], dipeptidyl-peptidase-IV action inactivates these peptide hormones. The relevance of this finding for their inactivation and their determination by immunoassays is discussed.},

   abstract = {Stimulated human osteosarcoma cells (MG-63) were used as a source of granulocyte chemotactic protein (GCP). In addition to the previously isolated GCP-1/IL-8, natural forms of GRO alpha, GRO gamma, and IP-10 were purified and identified by amino acid sequence analysis. Further, a novel GCP, GCP-2, was isolated in its natural form (6 kDa) and was found to be structurally related to the other members of the IL-8 family. GRO alpha, IP-10, and GCP-2 showed heterogeneity, in that several forms of each protein were recovered. These differed in truncation at the amino terminus. Reverse phase HPLC allowed us to separate four such different forms of GCP-2. These tumor-derived factors were compared in granulocyte activation and chemotaxis assays. IL-8 induced neutrophil gelatinase B release at 2 nM, but GRO alpha and GCP-2 showed a 5- to 10-fold lower specific activity. When the migration of granulocytes through polycarbonate micropore membranes was measured, GCP-2 and GRO alpha had a maximal chemotactic index comparable to that of IL-8. The minimal effective dose for GCP-2 and GRO alpha was 3 to 10 nM, whereas the specific activity of IL-8 was at least 10-fold higher. IP-10 was not active in this assay at doses up to 100 nM. Finally, in vivo chemotaxis was measured by using granulocyte recruitment in the rabbit skin model. After intradermal injection of 200 ng/site, GCP-2 provoked a significant granulocyte infiltration, albeit to a lesser extent than did IL-8 and GRO alpha. GCP-2 did not attract monocytes in vivo nor did it induce the cells in vitro to migrate or to produce enzyme. In conclusion, this study reveals a new member of the IL-8 family and shows that these related inflammatory mediators possess different potencies and efficacies towards granulocytes.},

USA F344 rats possess normal activity of this enzyme and served as matched controls. Intestinal brush-border membranes from the control rats were able to hydrolyze several proline-containing peptides. The hydrolytic ability of the brush-border membranes from the Japan rats against these peptides was markedly low. The difference in the hydrolytic activities between the two groups of rats was solely due to the absence of DPP IV in the Japan rats. There was no difference in the growth rate between the two groups of rats fed a reference diet whose protein constituents were not rich in proline. When the protein source was changed to gliadin, a proline-rich protein, USA F344 rats maintained their body weight for a 4-wk period on this diet, whereas the Japan rats experienced a significant weight loss under similar conditions. In situ perfusion experiments in intact animals revealed that the ability of morphiceptin (a peptide primarily hydrolyzable by DPP IV), when administered into the intestinal lumen, to block the cholera toxin-induced water secretion was significantly greater in Japan F344 rats than in USA F344 rats, indicating the resistance of morphiceptin to hydrolytic breakdown in the intestinal lumen of the Japan rats. It is concluded that the intestinal DPP IV plays a significant role in the hydrolysis of prolyl peptides and assimilation of proline-rich proteins.},

   abstract = {A computer searching algorithm has been used to identify protein sequences in the Protein Information Resource (PIR) database with peptide mass information (mass map) obtained from proteolytic digests of proteins analyzed by microcapillary high-performance liquid chromatography electrospray ionization mass spectrometry. A theoretical analysis of the cytochrome c family demonstrates the ability to identify protein sequences in the PIR database with a high degree of accuracy using a set of six predicted tryptic peptide masses. This method was also applied to experimentally determined peptide masses for a small GTP-binding protein, a protein from pig uterus, the human sex steroid binding protein, and a thermostable DNA polymerase. The results demonstrate that a set of observed masses which is less than 50% of the total number of predicted masses can be used to identify a protein sequence in the database. For the analysis presented in this paper, a mass matching tolerance of 1 amu is used. Under these conditions, mass maps created by fast atom bombardment mass spectrometry and matrix-assisted laser desorption time-of-flight would also be applicable. In cases where multiple matches are observed or verification of the protein identification is needed, tandem mass spectrometry sequencing can be used to establish sequence similarity.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a lymphocyte cell surface antigen which is increased during T-cell activation and is also expressed in other tissues. It is an atypical serine protease belonging to the prolyl oligopeptidase family. CD26 has been implicated in a variety of biological functions including T-cell activation, cell-to-cell adhesion, and recently in HIV infection. This paper describes, through the isolation and partial sequencing of eight human CD26 genomic clones, the first information on the genomic organization of the prolyl oligopeptidase family. We have established that the human CD26 gene spans approximately 70 kilobases (kb) and contains 26 exons, ranging in size from 45 base pairs (bp) to 1.4 kb. The nucleotides that encode the serine recognition site (G-W-S-Y-G) are split between two exons. This clearly distinguishes the genomic organization of the prolyl oligopeptidase family from that of the classical serine protease family. The 5' flanking domain of the CD26 gene contains neither a TATA box nor a CAAT box, but a 300 bp region extremely rich in C and G (72%) contains potential binding sites for several transcriptional factors. The human CD26 gene encodes two messages sized at about 4.2 and 2.8 kb. These are both expressed at high levels in the placenta and kidney and at moderate levels in the lung and liver. Only the 4.2 kb mRNA was expressed at low levels in skeletal muscle, heart, brain, and pancreas. Fluorescence in situ hybridization on metaphase chromosome spreads located the human CD26 gene to the long arm of chromosome 2(2q24.3).},

   abstract = {Hepatic fibrosis occurs as a consequence of net accumulation of matrix proteins (particularly collagen types I and III) in liver. Current concepts of the pathogenesis of liver fibrosis place major emphasis on the activation of hepatic lipocytes (fat-storing or Ito cells) to a myofibroblast-like phenotype with a consequent increase in their synthesis of matrix proteins. While this is an important factor, there is increasing evidence to indicate that liver fibrosis is a dynamic pathologic process in which altered matrix degradation may also play a significant role. Extracellular degradation of matrix proteins is regulated by a family of enzymes called the matrix metalloproteinases, which is subdivided into three groups; collagenases which degrade interstitial collagens (types I, II and III), type IV collagenases/gelatinases which degrade basement membrane (type IV) collagen and gelatins and stromelysins which degrade a broad range of substrates including proteoglycans, laminin, gelatins and fibronectin. The extracellular activity of these enzymes is regulated by several mechanisms which include alterations in gene transcription and proenzyme synthesis, cleavage of secreted proenzymes to active forms, and specific inhibition of activated forms by tissue inhibitor(s) of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). In liver, current evidence indicates that activated hepatic lipocytes and Kupffer cells play a central role in synthesis of matrix metalloproteinases. Under defined conditions they synthesize interstitial collagenase, 72 kDa and 95 kDa type IV collagenase/gelatinase and possibly stromelysin. Moreover, lipocytes also contribute to regulation of the extracellular activity of these enzymes by secretion of TIMP-1 and alpha 2-macroglobulin.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Monoclonal antibodies (mAb) against CD26 and ADAbp, respectively, showed a similar binding profile on various lymphocyte subsets from the peripheral blood. The adenosine deaminase (ADA) itself blocked the binding of a specific set of anti-CD26 mAb (among these the anti-TA5.9 mAb) on lymphocytic CD26; ADA also hindered the binding of soluble CD26 to the same immobilized anti-CD26 mAb. In addition, the interaction between immobilized ADA and purified CD26/DPP IV was inhibited by the anti-TA5.9 mAb. ADA did not inhibit the specific peptidase activity of CD26. Neither soluble nor immobilized ADA was able to down-modulate CD26 on the lymphocyte surface. Our data thus confirm the identity between ADAbp and CD26 and identify some epitopes, crucial in the binding of ADA to CD26.},

   abstract = {Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), a 28-amino acid peptide hormone, plays many physiological roles in the peripheral and central nervous systems. It has been proposed that endogenous VIP released from VIP-containing nerves is involved in the regulation of the secretory function of the endocrine pancreas. To test this hypothesis in vivo, we produced transgenic mice carrying the human VIP/peptide histidine methionine 27 (PHM-27) gene under the control of insulin promoter. In immunohistochemical analyses of islets, all the islet beta cells of transgenic mice were intensely stained for both VIP and PHM-27, consistent with the fact that these two peptides are encoded in a single mRNA (Itoh, N., Obata, K., Yanaihara, N., and Okamoto, H. (1983) Nature 304, 547-549). VIP was efficiently secreted from isolated transgenic islets in vitro. The blood glucose assays in free-fed mice indicated that the transgene lowered the blood glucose levels of transgenic mice (128 +/- 4 mg/dl) by about 20% below control levels (155 +/- 6 mg/dl). In the glucose tolerance test, at 60 min after glucose administration, the transgenic blood glucose levels (129 +/- 12 mg/dl) were much lower than control levels (175 +/- 13 mg/dl). The transgenic serum insulin levels at 15 min after glucose administration were 2.5-3.0-fold higher than control levels. The transgene was also effective in ameliorating glucose intolerance of 70% depancreatized mice. These results indicate that VIP and PHM-27 produced from the transgenic beta cells efficiently enhance glucose-induced insulin secretion from beta cells by an autocrine mechanism. These results also suggest that genetic manipulation of islet beta cells by the human VIP/PHM-27 gene or delivery of VIP to beta cells may ultimately provide a valuable approach to enhancing insulin secretion in clinical diabetes.},

   abstract = {The human fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP alpha) is a M(r) 95,000 cell surface antigen selectively expressed in reactive stromal fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, granulation tissue of healing wounds, and malignant cells of bone and soft tissue sarcomas. Normal adult tissues are generally FAP alpha-, but some fetal mesenchymal tissues transiently express the molecule. Because of its restricted normal tissue distribution and abundant expression in the stroma of over 90% of breast, colorectal, and lung carcinomas, FAP alpha is under clinical evaluation as a target for immunodetection and immunotherapy of epithelial cancers. In the present study, we have isolated a full-length cDNA for FAP alpha through expression cloning in COS-1 cells. The FAP alpha cDNA codes for a type II integral membrane protein with a large extracellular domain, transmembrane segment, and short cytoplasmic tail. FAP alpha shows 48% amino acid sequence identity to the T-cell activation antigen CD26, a membrane-bound protein with dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity; however, unlike FAP alpha, CD26 is widely expressed in normal tissues. Three catalytic domains shared by DPPIV homologues in different species and by other serine proteases are conserved in FAP alpha. Immunochemical analysis of COS-1 cells coexpressing FAP alpha and CD26 revealed that the two molecules form heteromeric cell surface complexes, suggesting that a previously identified FAP alpha-associated M(r) 105,000 protein of cultured fibroblasts and growth factor-stimulated melanocytes, FAP beta, is identical to CD26. In vivo coexpression of FAP alpha and CD26 is found in reactive fibroblasts of healing wounds but not in tumor stromal fibroblasts or sarcomas (FAP alpha +/CD26-). The putative serine protease activity of FAP alpha and its in vivo induction pattern may indicate a role for this molecule in the control of fibroblast growth or epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during development, tissue repair, and epithelial carcinogenesis.},

   abstract = {Insulin secretion from pancreatic islets is controlled by peptides as well as by nutrients. We report here a novel, extraordinarily potent peptidergic regulation of insulin secretion. A 27-residue form of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP27) as low as 10(-14) to 10(-13) M stimulated insulin release from rat islets in a glucose-dependent manner. PACAP27 also increased cytosolic free Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]i) in islet beta-cells. Nitrendipine, a blocker of the L-type Ca2+ channel, abolished both [Ca2+]i and insulin responses. Vasoactive intestinal peptide, a peptide exhibiting 68% amino acid homology with PACAP, also increased [Ca2+]i in beta-cells but only at concentrations in the nanomolar range, indicating that PACAP27 is 4 logs more potent. A 38-residue form of the peptide (PACAP38) stimulated insulin release and increased beta-cell [Ca2+]i in a manner similar to that of PACAP27. PACAP-like immunoreactivity was demonstrated in pancreatic nerve fibers, islets, and capillaries. The results indicate that PACAP is a physiologically occurring peptide in pancreas and that PACAP, in a glucose-dependent manner, activates beta-cells presumably via a high affinity PACAP-selective receptor, raises [Ca2+]i by increasing the activity of L-type Ca2+ channels, and consequently stimulates insulin release. PACAP appears to be by far the most potent insulinotropic peptide known.},

IP-10 had no effect on endothelial cell growth, attachment, and migration as assayed in vitro. These results document an important biological property of IP-10 and raise the possibility that IP-10 may participate in the regulation of angiogenesis during inflammation and tumorigenesis.},

   abstract = {The dipeptidyl peptidase IV gene encodes a plasma-membrane exopeptidase that is highly expressed in small intestine, lung and kidney. In order to better understand the mechanisms responsible for this tissue-specific expression we cloned, sequenced and functionally characterized the 5'-flanking region of the human dipeptidyl peptidase IV gene. The first 500 bases of the 5'-flanking sequence constituted an unmethylated CpG island, contained several Sp1-binding sites and lacked a consensus TATA box, all characteristics of gene promoters lacking tissue-specific expression. RNase-protection analysis using both small intestinal and Caco2 cell RNA indicated that the dipeptidyl peptidase IV transcript was initiated from no fewer than six major and 12 minor start sites. The 5'-flanking sequence also exhibited functional promoter activity in transient transfection experiments. Here, various lengths of the sequence were cloned upstream of a luciferase gene and introduced into cultured cells using lipofectin. A region located between bases -150 and -109 relative to the start of translation was found to be important for high-level promoter activity in both Caco2 and HepG2 cells. Moreover, Caco2 cells and HepG2 cells, which express high levels of dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity, exhibited much higher normalized luciferase activity after transfection than did 3T3, Jurkat or COS-7 cells, which have low enzyme levels. Sodium butyrate was found to increase both enzyme activity and normalized luciferase in HepG2 cells. Thus the dipeptidyl peptidase IV promoter possesses the ability to initiate transcription in a tissue-specific fashion in spite of having the sequence characteristics of a housekeeping gene promoter.},

   abstract = {Objective To investigate the relaxant action of histamine on human corpus cavernosum in vitro and the erectile response caused by the intracavernous injection of histamine in patients with psychogenic impotence. Patients and methods Human corpus cavernosum (HCC) tissue was cut into strips of approximately 2 cm and suspended in a cascade bioassay. The strips were then superfused with oxygenated and warmed Krebs solution and precontracted with nor adrenaline (3 μm). Glyceryl trinitrate, acetylcholine and histamine were injected as a single bolus in the absence or in the presence of mepyramine and cimetidine. For the in vivo studies, histamine (30–60 μg) was injected intra-cavernously as a single bolus into the right corpus cavernosum 1 cm from the balamo-preputial sulcus. Similar protocols were carried out for papaverine (50 mg). The erectile response was divided into four grades: no response, tumescence, partial and full erection. ResultsIn vitro studies demonstrated that histamine (3–100 μg) caused dose-dependent relaxation of the HCC strips which was significantly inhibited by cimetidine (5–10 μm). The histamine H1 receptor antagonist mepyramine (1 μm) potentiated histamine-induced relaxation. The co-infusion of both mepyramine and cimetidine did not abolish histamine-induced relaxation. When injected intracavernously in humans, histamine (30 μg) caused full erection in 13% of the patients, whereas 87% had partial erection or tumescence. A higher dose of histamine (60 μg) caused full erection in 26% of the patients and 74% had partial erection or tumescence. Papaverine induced full erection in the majority of patients (66%). In contrast to papaverine, the duration of erection induced by histamine was markedly shorter (mean 200 and 6.5 min, respectively). The penile erections induced by papaverine were associated with complications such as pain, haematoma and priapism. Histamine did not induce any complications. Treatment of eight male patients with psychogenic impotence with the histamine H1 receptor antagonist astemizol (10 mg orally once daily for 1 week) did not affect histamine-induced erectile responses. Conclusion These results indicate that histamine may play a role in human penile erection. The erection-promoting action of histamine is probably due to H2 receptor activation, although another histamine receptor, possibly H3, also seems to be involved. This study suggests that histamine could be a valuable tool in the diagnosis of erectile dysfunction.},

Some of these data sources are conventional databases implemented using database management systems (DBMSs) and others are structured files maintained in a number of different formats (e.g., ASN.1 and ACE). In addition, software packages such as sequence analysis packages (e.g., BLAST and FASTA) produce data and can therefore be viewed as data sources. To counter the increasing dispersion and heterogeneity of data, different approaches to integrating these data sources are appearing throughout the bioinformatics community.

Measurement by RIA is hampered by the fact that most antisera are side-viewing or C-terminally directed, and recognize both intact GLP-1 and biologically inactive. N-terminally truncated fragments. Using high pressure liquid chromatography in combination with RIAs, methodology allowing specific determination of both intact GLP-1 and its metabolites was developed. Human plasma was shown to degrade GLP-1-(7-36)amide, forming an N-terminally truncated peptide with a t1/2 of 20.4 +/- 1.4 min at 37 C (n = 6). This was unaffected by EDTA or aprotinin. Inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV or low temperature (4 C) completely prevented formation of the metabolite, which was confirmed to be GLP-1-(9-36)amide by mass spectrometry and sequence analysis. High pressure liquid chromatography revealed the concentration of GLP-1-(9-36)amide to be 53.5 +/- 13.7% of the concentration of endogenous intact GLP-1 in the fasted state, which increased to 130.8 +/- 10.0% (P < 0.01; n = 6) 1 h postprandially. Metabolism at the C-terminus was not observed. This study suggests that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV is the primary mechanism for GLP-1 degradation in human plasma in vitro and may have a role in inactivating the peptide in vivo.},

   abstract = {Prolyl oligopeptidase was isolated and purified to homogeneity from human lymphocytes, yielding a specific activity of 7780 mU/mg. The molecular mass using size-exclusion chromatography matches the 76 kDa obtained by SDS/PAGE. This provides evidence that prolyl oligopeptidase is a monomer. The isoelectric point is 4.8 as judged by isoelectric focusing in free solution. Di-isopropyl fluorophosphate and phenylmethylsulphonyl fluoride completely abolish the activity, classifying the enzyme as a serine proteinase. The inhibition by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid indicates the importance of a free sulfhydryl group near the active-site. alpha(1)-Casein and ornithine decarboxylase, two proteins containing a PEST sequence, inhibit prolyl oligopeptidase, but were not hydrolyzed. This demonstrates that prolyl oligopeptidase is not participating in the metabolism of proteins according to a PEST-dependent pathway. alpha(1)-Antitrypsin partially inhibits the enzyme but in contrast, aprotinin does not. Its inability to cleave corticotropin-releasing factor, ubiquitin, albumin and aprotinin, together with the hydrolysis of bradykinin between Pro7-Arg8 confirms the affinity of prolyl oligopeptidase for small peptides. Multiple sequence alignment does not reveal any similarity with proteases of known tertiary structure. Secondary-structure prediction displays striking similarity with dipeptidyl peptidase IV and acylaminoacyl peptidase. Two characteristic features of the members of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases are highlighted: the linear arrangement of the catalytic triad is nucleophile-acid-base and the proteolytic cleavage releasing the catalytically active C-terminal region of around 500 amino acids from the N-terminal sequence. Secondary structure prediction and comparison of the active-site of serine proteinases with known three-dimensional coordinates prove that Asp641 is the third member of the catalytic triad. The secondary structural organization of the protease domain of prolyl oligopeptidase is in accordance with the alpha/beta hydrolase fold.},

The onset of the syndrome is insidious, and diagnosis is usually delayed by months to years. Morbidity and mortality from untreated WDHA syndrome are related to long-standing dehydration and electrolyte and acid-base disturbances resulting in chronic renal failure. Diagnosis requires documentation of large volumes of secretory diarrhea, elevated serum VIP levels, and localization of the VIP-secreting tumor. Treatment includes correction of volume, electrolyte, and metabolic abnormalities, pharmacotherapy to decrease gastrointestinal secretion and increase absorption, and ultimately surgical resection or debulking of the vipoma.},

   abstract = {The combined actions of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and truncated glucagon-like peptide-1 (tGLP-1) may fully account for the incretin effect. These hormones are released from the small intestine in response to oral glucose and stimulate insulin release. Recently, evidence has been provided demonstrating the degradation of GIP-(1-42) and GLP-1-(7-36)NH2 by the serum enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) into the biologically inactive products GIP-(3-42) and GLP-1-(9-36)NH2. The objective of the current investigation was to develop a method to monitor the degradation of these hormones in vivo. Synthetic peptides were radiolabeled and purified by HPLC. Subsequent degradation of the peptides under various conditions was then monitored by further HPLC analysis. Incubation of [125I]GIP-(1-42) or [125I]GLP-1-(7-36)NH2 with Wistar rat serum or purified DPP IV resulted in the major N-terminal-truncated products [125I]GIP-(3-42) and [125I]GLP-1-(9-36)NH2. These products were significantly reduced when the specific DPP IV inhibitor diprotin A was included in the incubation mixture and were absent when serum from DPP IV-deficient rats was used. When the labeled peptides were infused into rats at hormone levels within the physiological range, over 50% was metabolized to the truncated forms within 2 min. These products were absent when the tracers were infused into DPP IV-deficient animals. It is concluded that DPP IV may be a primary inactivating enzyme of both GIP and tGLP-1 in vivo. As the N-terminal-truncated products of the DPP IV cleavage may not be distinguished from the biologically active hormone by currently employed assays, reports of circulating hormone levels should be reconsidered. The method described in this manuscript may be useful for investigating the durations of action of GIP and tGLP-1 in normal and pathophysiological conditions.},

By means of a new non-radioactive method using fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled and unlabelled anti-CD26 monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry, we measured the internalization and re-expression of CD26 on freshly isolated resting human T lymphocytes. The modulation of CD26 surface expression takes place in primarily CD26+ as well as in CD26- T lymphocytes, indicating the presence of an intracellular CD26 pool. In fact, with two different anti-CD26 monoclonal antibodies (Ta1 and M5) intracellular CD26 was detected out of which newly expressed CD26 might have originated. This intracellular CD26 pool appears to be maintained by continuous translation of CD26 mRNA.},

   abstract = {Many biologically important peptide sequences contain proline. It confers unique conformational constraints on the peptide chain in that the side-chain is cyclized back onto the backbone amide position. Inside an alpha-helix the possibility of making hydrogen bonds to the preceding turn is lost and a kink will be introduced. The conformational restrictions imposed by proline motifs in a peptide chain appear to imply important structural or biological functions as can be deduced from their often remarkably high degree of conservation as found in many proteins and peptides, especially cytokines, growth factors, G-protein-coupled receptors, V3 loops of the HIV envelope glycoprotein gp120, and neuro- and vasoactive peptides. Only a limited number of peptidases are known to be able to hydrolyze proline adjacent bonds. Their activity is influenced by the isomeric state (cis-trans) as well as the position of proline in the peptide chain. The three proline specific metallo-peptidases (aminopeptidase P, carboxypeptidase P and prolidase) are activated by Mn2+, whereas the three serine type peptidases cleaving a post proline bond (prolyl oligopeptidase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV, and prolylcarboxypeptidase) share the sequential order of the catalytic Ser-Asp-His triade, which differentiates them from the chymotrypsin (His-Asp-Ser) and subtilisin (Asp-His-Ser) families. An endo or C terminal Pro-Pro bond and an endo pre-Pro peptide bond possess a high degree of resistance to any mammalian proteolytic enzyme.},

The entire program is estimated to consist of fewer than 35 up-regulated and fewer than 10 down-regulated genes; 17 and 4 of them, respectively, have been isolated and characterized. Up-regulated genes whose function can be predicted on the basis of their sequence include four transcription factors (including one of the thyroid hormone receptors), an extracellular matrix component (fibronectin) and membrane receptor (integrin), four proteinases, a deiodinase that degrades thyroid hormone, and a protein that binds the hypothalamic corticotropin-releasing factor, which has been implicated in controlling thyroid hormone synthesis in Xenopus tadpoles. All four down-regulated genes encode extracellular proteins that are expressed in tadpole epidermis. This survey of the program provides insights into the biology of metamorphosis. IMAGES:},

   abstract = {CD26, a T cell activation Ag, also known as dipeptidyl peptidase IV, is directly associated with adenosine deaminase (ADA) on the surface of T cells and T cell lines. In the present study, we examined both the binding of ADA and CD26 and the functional consequences of this interaction. We found that ADA was associated with CD26 on T cell lines lacking either ADA or dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzymatic activity, indicating that the association between dipeptidyl peptidase IV and ADA did not require enzymatic activity. Moreover, using immunoelectron microscopy, we demonstrated that CD26 and ADA co-localized on the cell surface, but not inside cells, suggesting that CD26 did not transport ADA to the surface. In keeping with this observation, we showed that human CD26-transfected murine pre-B cell lines lacking human ADA acquired ADA from an extracellular source. More importantly, adenosine in the absence of cell surface ADA inhibited T cell proliferation and IL-2 production induced by various stimuli. On the other hand, cells expressing ADA and CD26 on the surface were much more resistant to the inhibitory effect of adenosine. These data suggest that ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to cell surface CD26, and this complex is capable of reducing the local concentration of adenosine.},

For β-casomorphin-7 and β-casokinin-10, lymphocyte proliferation was suppressed at lower concentrations, but stimulated at higher concentrations (≥10−7 mol/l). Protein synthesis was stimulated (maxima at 25%) only with Tyr-Gly and Tyr-Gly-Gly.

A silver-stained one-dimensional gel of a fraction from yeast proteins was analyzed by nanoelectrospray tandem mass spectrometry. In the sequencing, more than 1000 amino acids were covered, resulting in no evidence of chemical modifications due to the silver staining procedure. Silver staining allows a substantial shortening of sample preparation time and may, therefore, be preferable over Coomassie staining.

   abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) has recently been identified as a stimulator of intestinal epithelial growth, prompting the development of RIA and HPLC methodologies to study this peptide in more detail. A GLP-2-specific antiserum (UTTH-7) was developed that recognizes amino acids 25-30 of human and rat GLP-2-(1-33). UTTH-7 cross-reacts with N- and C-terminally modified forms of GLP-2, proglucagon, and the major proglucagon fragment. Analysis of rat ileal extracts demonstrated the presence of GLP-2-(1-33) as well as significant amounts of GLP-2-(3-33) (16 +/- 7% of total GLP-2). The level of total immunoreactive GLP-2 in plasma from fasted rats was 700 +/- 71 pg/ml, and this increased 3.6-fold (P < 0.001) in 24-h fed rats. HPLC analysis demonstrated the presence of both GLP-2-(1-33) and GLP-2-(3-33) in plasma from fasted rats, with increments in both peptides in plasma from fed rats. Immunoreactive GLP-2 increased in plasma from human subjects 2 h after a meal, rising from 851 +/- 230 to 1106 +/- 211 pg/ml (P < 0.05); 15 +/- 4% of this immunoreactivity was accounted for by the presence of intact GLP-2. HPLC showed the presence of both GLP-2-(1-33) and GLP-2-(3-33) in plasma from fed humans. Incubation of human GLP-2-(1-33) with the enzyme dipeptidylpeptidase IV resulted in liberation of GLP-2-(3-33), whereas replacement of Ala2 with Gly2 prevented this cleavage. Thus, while GLP-2-(1-33) is a major circulating and tissue form of GLP-2, GLP-2-(3-33) is a significant component ofimmunoreactive GLP-2 in both intestine and plasma.},

   abstract = {Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI MS) has been used to generate ion images of samples in one or more mass-to-charge (m/z) values, providing the capability of mapping specific molecules to two-dimensional coordinates of the original sample. The high sensitivity of the technique (low-femtomole to attomole levels for proteins and peptides) allows the study of organized biochemical processes occurring in, for example, mammalian tissue sections. The mass spectrometer is used to determine the molecular weights of the molecules in the surface layers of the tissue. Molecules desorbed from the sample typically are singly protonated, giving an ion at (M + H)+, where M is the molecular mass. The procedure involves coating the tissue section, or a blotted imprint of the section, with a thin layer of energy-absorbing matrix and then analyzing the sample to produce an ordered array of mass spectra, each containing nominal m/z values typically covering a range of over 50 000 Da. Images can be displayed in individual m/z values as a selected ion image, which would localize individual compounds in the tissue, or as summed ion images. MALDI ion images of tissue sections can be obtained directly from tissue slices following preparative steps, and this is demonstrated for the mapping of insulin contained in an islet in a section of rat pancreas, hormone peptides in a small area of a section of rat pituitary, and a small protein bound to the membrane of human mucosa cells. Alternatively, imprints of the tissue can be analyzed by blotting the tissue sections on specially prepared targets containing an adsorbent material, e.g., C-18 coated resin beads. Peptides and small proteins bind to the C-18 and create a positive imprint of the tissue which can then be imaged by the mass spectrometer. This is demonstrated for the MALDI ion image analysis of regions of rat splenic pancreas and for an area of rat pituitary traversing the anterior, intermediate, and posterior regions where localized peptides were mapped. In a single spectrum from the anterior/intermediate lobe of a rat pituitary print, over 50 ions corresponding to the peptides present in this tissue were observed as well as precursors, isoforms, and metabolic frag ments.},

   abstract = {Data warehousing and on-line analytical processing (OLAP) are essential elements of decision support, which has increasingly become a focus of the database industry. Many commercial products and services are now available, and all of the principal database management system vendors now have offerings in these areas. Decision support places some rather different requirements on database technology compared to traditional on-line transaction processing applications. This paper provides an overview of data warehousing and OLAP technologies, with an emphasis on their new requirements. We describe back end tools for extracting, cleaning and loading data into a data warehouse; multidimensional data models typical of OLAP; front end client tools for querying and data analysis; server extensions for efficient query processing; and tools for metadata management and for managing the warehouse. In addition to surveying the state of the art, this paper also identifies some promising research issues, some of which are related to problems that the database research community has worked on for years, but others are only just beginning to be addressed. This overview is based on a tutorial that the authors presented at the VLDB Conference, 1996.},

   abstract = {Research of a cellular pathway activated by IL-12 which may result in new therapeutical approaches for IL-12, led us to find an intriguing relationship between IL-12 and CD26/DPPIV ectopeptidase on activated T cells. Both the percentage and median fluorescence intensity (MFI) of CD26+ cells in the PHA-stimulated PBMC or lymphoblasts increased when IL-12 (optimum dose, 2 ng/ml) was present. Maximum CD26 expression was observed on day-2 cultures of lymphoblasts, the presence of IL-12 receptor probably being necessary for this upregulation. In addition, CD26 upregulation correlated with enhanced DPPIV function. Enzyme affinity and secretion of the soluble form of DPPIV were not affected by IL-12. Kinetic behaviours of Ag expression and enzymatic activity support a different CD26 regulation pathway by IL-12. These data suggest that the correlation found in vivo between the CD26 expression and Th1-like immune responses is due to this IL-12-dependent upregulation.},

These peptidases cover practically all situations where a proline residue might occur in a potential substrate. In this paper we endeavour to discuss these enzymes, particularly those responsible for peptide or protein hydrolysis at proline sites. We have detailed their discovery, biochemical attributes and substrate specificities and have provided information as to the methodology used to detect and manipulate their activities.

We demonstrate that glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2), shown to be highly intestinotrophic in mice, promotes an increase in intestinal villus height but has no trophic effect on small bowel weight in rats. The reduced intestinotrophic activity of GLP-2 in rats is attributable to inactivation by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). GLP-2(1-33) was degraded to GLP-2(3-33) following incubation with human placental DPP-IV or rat serum but not by serum from DPP-IV-deficient rats. Administration of rat GLP-2 to DPP-IV-deficient rats was associated with markedly increased bioactivity of rat GLP-2 resulting in a significant increase in small bowel weight. A synthetic GLP-2 analog, r[Gly2]GLP-2, with an alanine to glycine substitution at position 2, was resistant to cleavage by both DPP-IV and rat serum in vitro. Treatment of wild-type rats with r[Gly2]GLP-2 produced a statistically significant increase in small bowel mass. DPP-IV-mediated inactivation of GLP-2 is a critical determinant of the growth factor-like properties of GLP-2.},

   abstract = {ERLANSON-ALBERTSSON, CHARLOTTE, DAVID YORK. Enterostatin-a peptide regulating fat intake. A high fat intake, together with an inability to match lipid oxidation to fat intake, has been found to be correlated with obesity in humans. This review describes our current understanding of enterostatin, a peptide that selectively reduces fat intake. Enterostatin is formed in the intestine by the cleavage of secreted pancreatic procolipase, the remaining colipase serving as an obligatory cofactor for pancreatic lipase during fat digestion. Enterostatin is also produced in the gastric mucosa and the mucosal epithelia of the small intestine. Procolipase gene transcription and enterostatin release into the gastrointestinal lumen are increased by high-fat diets. After feeding, enterostatin appears in the lymph and circulation. Enterostatin will selectively inhibit fat intake during normal feeding and in experimental paradigms that involve dietary choice. Its anorectic effect has been demonstrated in a number of species. Both peripheral and central sites of action have been proposed. The peripheral mechanism involves an afferent vagal signaling pathway to hypothalamic centers. The central responses are mediated through a pathway that includes both serotonergic and opioidergic components. Chronically, enterostatin reduces fat intake, bodyweight, and body fat. This response may involve multiple metabolic effects of enterostatin, which include a reduction of insulin secretion, an increase in sympathetic drive to brown adipose tissue, and the stimulation of adrenal corticosteroid secretion. A possible pathophysiological role is suggested by studies that have linked low enterostatin production and/or responsiveness to strains of rat that become obese and prefer dietary fat. Humans with obesity also exhibit a lower secretion of pancreatic procolipase after a test meal, compared with persons of normal weight.},

To investigate the role of N-glycosylation in the function of DPPIV, three of its asparagine residues were separately converted to glutamine by site-directed mutagenesis. The resulting N-glycosylation mutants of rat DPPIV were studied in stable transfected Chinese hamster ovary cells. All three N-glycosylation mutants of DPPIV showed a reduced half-life, as well as differing degrees of inhibition of the processing of their N-glycans. Mutation of the first (Asn83-->Gln) or eighth (Asn686-->Gln) N-glycosylation site had only a small effect on its enzymatic activity, cell-surface expression and dimer formation, whereas the mutation of the sixth N-glycosylation site (Asn319-->Gln) abolished the enzymatic activity, eliminated cell-surface expression and prevented the dimerization of the DPPIV protein. The mutant [Gln319]DPPIV is retained in the cytoplasm and its degradation was drastically increased. Our data suggest that the N-glycosylation at Asn319 is involved in protein trafficking and correct protein folding.},

   abstract = {Seprase is a homodimeric 170 kDa integral membrane gelatinase whose expression correlates with the invasiveness of the human melanoma cell line LOX. Here, we report the molecular cloning of a cDNA that encodes the 97 kDa subunit of seprase. Its deduced amino acid sequence predicts a type II integral membrane protein with a cytoplasmic tail of 6 amino acids, followed by a transmembrane domain of 20 amino acids and an extracellular domain of 734 amino acids. The carboxyl terminus contains a putative catalytic region (approximately 200 amino acids) which is homologous (68% identity) to that of the nonclassical serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). The conserved serine protease motif G-X-S-X-G is present as G-W-S-Y-G. However, sequence analysis of seprase cDNA from LOX and other cell lines strongly suggests that seprase and human fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP alpha) are products of the same gene. We propose that seprase/FAP alpha and DPPIV represent a new subfamily of serine integral membrane proteases (SIMP).},

   abstract = {Antihistaminic drugs have been used successfully for many years in the treatment of allergic diseases. Second-generation antihistamines have fewer sedating side effects than first-generation agents, and the number of newer drugs available for clinical use is growing. Various methods have been used to assess antihistaminic activity, the most popular of which is the epicutaneous histamine-induced wheal and flare. This test relies on the ability of epicutaneously injected histamine to bring about the wheal and flare, a neurovascular response that involves reflex vasodilation (flare) and local swelling caused by plasma extravasation (wheal). Antihistamines have been compared on the basis of their ability to block the histamine-induced wheal and flare in the skin. Results of these trials have been applied to predict the global antiallergic efficacy of various antihistamines. This review has examined the reliability of suppression of the histamine wheal and flare reaction in the skin to predict an antihistamine's clinical efficacy in two common allergic diseases, seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria. Although histamine is one mediator in the allergic response in the skin and nasal mucosa, many other agents are important modulators of the allergic response. In addition, the major structural and functional differences that exist between the nasal mucosa and the skin affect the type of local response. These manifest themselves as differences between the responses to antigen and histamine challenge in the skin and the nose. The allergic responses in these tissues are not simply the consequence of one chemical but are the result of a cascade of interactions among various cells and mediators. The clinical manifestations of these complex interactions obviously cannot be fully replicated by injection of one chemical mediator, histamine, into the outer layer of the skin. Studies with antihistamines have shown that certain drugs, such as cetirizine, are more suppressive than others (loratadine, terfenadine) in controlling the histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction in the skin. When the clinical efficacy of these medications is compared in clinical trials in seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria, all are equally efficacious in controlling symptoms. Although the histamine-induced wheal and flare reaction can serve as a useful clinical pharmacologic test to assess dose-response relations for an antihistamine, its lack of correlation with clinical responses among antihistamines indicates that this model should not be used to predict or compare clinical efficacies of antihistamines in seasonal allergic rhinitis and chronic idiopathic urticaria.

   abstract = {The growth of solid neoplasms requires the recruitment of a supporting stroma. In most epithelial cancers, this stromal compartment comprises newly formed blood vessels and abundant, reactive stromal fibroblasts. Tumor stromal fibroblasts are not transformed but differ from resting fibrocytes in normal adult tissues by an altered pattern of gene expression. In human cancers, this includes induction of the cell-surface-bound fibroblast-activation protein (FAP), a member of the serine protease family encoded by the FAP gene on chromosome 2. In this study, we have cloned a complementary DNA for Fap, the murine homologue of FAP. The predicted murine FAP protein, mFAP, shares 89% amino-acid-sequence identity with human FAP, including a perfectly conserved catalytic triad. Cultured mouse embryo fibroblasts and mouse embryonic tissues were found to express Fap transcripts. In addition, the host-derived, fibroblast-rich stroma of human epithelial-cancer xenografts grown in immunodeficient mice also expresses Fap. Sequencing of reverse-transcription-PCR products indicates that 3 distinct Fap splice variants can be detected in tissues. Our findings suggest a close similarity in structure and tissue expression of FAP in different species. By extending the analysis of FAP to the mouse, new in vivo test systems become available for genetic and therapeutic manipulations and for the study of FAP regulation and function in embryonic development and in epithelial cancers.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a leukocyte activation marker that possesses dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity but whose natural substrates and immunological functions have not been clearly defined. Several chemo-kines, including RANTES (regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed and secreted), have now been shown to be substrates for recombinant soluble human CD26. The truncated RANTES(3-68) lacked the ability of native RANTES(1-68) to increase the cytosolic calcium concentration in human monocytes, but still induced this response in macrophages activated with macrophage colony-stimulating factor. Analysis of chemokine receptor messenger RNAs and patterns of desensitization of chemokine responses showed that the differential activity of the truncated molecule results from an altered receptor specificity. RANTES(3-68) showed a reduced activity, relative to that of RANTES(1-68), with cells expressing the recombinant CCR1 chemokine receptor, but retained the ability to stimulate CCR5 receptors and to inhibit the cytopathic effects of HIV-1. Our results indicate that CD26-mediated processing together with cell activation-induced changes in receptor expression provides an integrated mechanism for differential cell recruitment and for the regulation of target cell specificity of RANTES, and possibly other chemokines.},

   abstract = {The 170-kDa membrane-bound gelatinase, seprase, is a cell surface protease, the expression of which correlates with the invasive phenotype of human melanoma and carcinoma cells. We have isolated seprase from cell membranes and shed vesicles of LOX human melanoma cells. The active enzyme is a dimer of N-glycosylated 97-kDa subunits. Sequence analysis of three internal proteolytic fragments of the 97-kDa polypeptide revealed up to 87.5% identity to the 95-kDa fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPalpha), the function of which is unknown. Thus, we used reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction to generate a 2.4-kilobase cDNA from LOX mRNA with FAPalpha primers. COS-7 cells transfected with this cDNA expressed a 170-kDa gelatinase that is recognized by monoclonal antibodies directed against seprase. Sequence analysis also showed similarities to the 110-kDa subunit of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV). Like DPPIV, the gelatinase activity of seprase was completely blocked by serine-protease inhibitors, including diisopropyl fluorophosphate. Seprase could be affinity-labeled by [3H]diisopropyl fluorophosphate, but the proteolytically inactive 97-kDa subunit could not, confirming the existence of a serine protease active site on the dimeric form. Proteolytic activity is lost upon dissociation into its 97-kDa subunit following treatment with acid, heat, or cysteine and histidine-modifying agents. We conclude that seprase, FAPalpha, and DPPIV are related serine integral membrane proteases and that seprase is similar to DPPIV, the proteolytic activities of which are dependent upon subunit association.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV, CD26) is a serine exoprotease which selectively cleaves the penultimate proline residue of polypeptides. This enzyme is also expressed as a surface marker on activated T cells. In order to assess the relevance of DP IV in immunological disorders, we evaluated the in vivo effects of specific DP IV inhibitors using two arthritis models, one which was induced by collagen one by alkyldiamine. These animal models share several pathological features associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The transition state substrate analog of DP IV, (S)-Alanylpyrrolidine-boronic Acid (Ala-boroPro), suppressed hind paw swelling, which was associated with collagen-induced and alkyldiamine-induced arthritis. A competitive inhibitor of DP IV, Lys(Z(NO2))-thiazolidide and an irreversible inhibitor, Ala-Pro-nitrobenzoylhydroxylamine also suppressed alkyldiamine-induced arthritis dose-dependently. We also analyzed the pharmacological effects of Lys(Z(NO2))-thiazolidide on several immune responses in vitro, in order to determine its mode of action. This inhibitor suppressed mitogen-induced and antigen-induced proliferation of T cells. However, studies using splenic cells from DP IV deficient rats showed that the inhibition of lymphocyte proliferation was not exerted through the inhibition of DP IV.},

Human GCP-2 (75 residues) was synthesized on a 0.25-mmol scale using Fmoc chemistry. After disulfide bridge formation and purification, monomeric GCP-2 was recovered as a 6-kDa protein; the pure synthetic protein showed a molecular mass of 8076 Da as determined by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). The exact amino acid sequence of synthetic GCP-2 was confirmed by Edman degradation. Synthetic GCP-2 was an equally active (minimal effective concentration of 1−3 nM) chemoattractant for neutrophilic granulocytes as was natural 75-residue GCP-2. At concentrations up to 30 nM, synthetic GCP-2 did not stimulate eosinophil, monocyte, or lymphocyte chemotaxis. GCP-2 induced a dose-dependent increase in [Ca2+]i in neutrophils, 1 nM being the minimal effective concentration. The GCP-2-induced [Ca2+]i increase was completely prevented by pertussis toxin. Prestimulation of neutrophils with equimolar concentrations of purified natural IL-8, GROα, GROγ and ENA-78 abolished the [Ca2+]i increase in response to 1 nM GCP-2. Alternatively, the [Ca2+]i rise induced by these CXC chemokines was inhibited by pretreatment of neutrophils with GCP-2. GCP-2 stimulated [Ca2+]i increases in CXCR1- and CXCR2-transfected cells, demonstrating that GCP-2 binds to both IL-8 receptors. Intradermal injection of synthetic GCP-2 resulted in a dose-dependent neutrophil accumulation and plasma extravasation in rabbit skin. To provoke this skin reaction, GCP-2 (10 pmol/site) was nearly as effective as IL-8, indicating that it is an important complementary mediator of the inflammatory response.},

Using these sequences, we have cloned five novel human CC chemokines termed TARC, LARC, ELC, SLC, and PARC. These chemokines are constitutively expressed especially in some lymphoid tissues with individually unique expression patterns. The recombinant proteins are all found to be selectively chemotactic for lymphocytes but not for monocytes or neutrophils. Each chemokine appears to interact with a class of receptors on lymphocytes that is not shared by any other chemokines so far tested. Furthermore, we have identified CCR4 as the specific receptor for TARC, GPR-CY4/DRY6/CKR-L3/STRL22 as that for LARC (CCR6), and EBI1/BLR2 as that for ELC (CCR7). Only the gene for PARC is mapped to the traditional CC chemokine gene cluster at chromosome 17q11.2, whereas those for TARC, LARC, ELC, and SLC are localized at different loci. Collectively, these five CC chemokines may constitute a new category of CC chemokines that are involved in trafficking and homing of particular subsets of lymphocytes in particular lymphoid tissue microenvironments.},

   abstract = {Endothelial cell adhesion molecules are partly responsible for the distinct organ distribution of cancer metastases. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) expressed on rat lung capillary endothelia is shown here to be an adhesion receptor for rat breast cancer cells and to mediate lung colonization by these tumor cells. Fibronectin (FN) assembled on breast cancer cell surfaces into multiple, randomly dispersed globules from cellular and plasma FN is identified as the principal ligand for DPP IV. Ligand expression correlates quantitatively with the tumor cells' capabilities to bind to DPP IV and to metastasize to the lungs. DPP IV/FN-mediated adhesion and metastasis are blocked when tumor cells are incubated with soluble DPP IV prior to conducting adhesion and lung colony assays. Adhesion is also blocked by anti-DPP IV monoclonal antibody 6A3 and anti-FN antiserum. However, adhesion to immobilized FN is unaffected by soluble plasma FN and, thus, can happen during hematogenous spread of cancer cells at high plasma FN concentrations. The ability of many cancer cells to capture FN molecules on their surface and to augment such deposits by FN self-association during passage in the blood suggests that DPP IV/FN binding may be a relatively common mechanism for lung metastasis.},

In nonfasted anesthetized pigs, valine-pyrrolidide (a stable and selective inhibitor of DPP IV), at a dose that reduced plasma DPP IV activity by more than 90%, increased both the amount of intact GLP-1 in the basal state (from 5 +/- 1 to 18 +/- 7 pmol/l; P < 0.05) and the proportion remaining undegraded during an infusion (from 21.0 +/- 1.3 to 102.3 +/- 4.5%; P < 0.0001). This was associated with a prolonged plasma half-life for the intact peptide (from 1.0 +/- 0.1 to 3.2 +/- 0.2 min; P < 0.0005). In the basal (nonfasted) state, valine-pyrrolidide potentiated the effect of intravenous GLP-1 on the incremental area under the curve (AUC) for glucose (-0.50 +/- 0.91 to -2.83 +/- 0.59 20 min x mmol x l(-1); P < 0.05) and insulin (23.8 +/- 30.5 to 332.5 +/- 99.6 20 min x pmol x l(-1); P < 0.05). When an intravenous glucose load was given during the GLP-1 infusion, valine-pyrrolidide augmented the insulin response (AUC, 2,086.2 +/- 600.9 to 6,247.0 +/- 1443.9 40 min x pmol x l(-1); P < 0.05). These results suggest that by reducing GLP-1 degradation, DPP IV inhibition potentiates the insulinotropic effect of GLP-1 and may, therefore, be a viable approach to the management of diabetes.},

Intracerebroventricular (icv) β-casomorphin1–7 (β-CM1–7) stimulated intake of HF diet in overnight fasted rats, but β-CM1–5 and β-CM1–4 were ineffective. Peripheral injection of β-CM1–7 also increased the intake of a high fat diet, but reduced the intake of HC diet in satiated rats. Intracerebroventricular (ICV) β-CM1–7 caused a dose-dependent increase in the intake of HF diet, but a dose-dependent inhibition of HC ingestion in satiated rats. Enterostatin (ICV) inhibited the β-CM1–7 stimulation of HF intake, as did the general opioid antagonist naloxone. Ligand binding studies with [3H-pro] enterostatin identified on low affinity binding site (Kd 100nM) on a crude brain membrane preparation. This binding was displaced by β-CM1–7, β-CM1–5 and β-CM1–4. These data suggest that at high doses enterostatin and β-CM1–7 may interact with the same low affinity receptor to modulate intake of dietary fat.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a widely distributed 110 kD cell-surface glycoprotein with known dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP-IV) activity in its extracellular domain. This ecto-enzyme is capable of cleaving amino terminal dipeptides from polypeptides with either L-proline or L-alanine in the penultimate position. On human T cells, CD26 expression appears late in thymic differentiation and is preferentially restricted to the CD4+ helper/memory population, and CD26 can deliver a potent co-stimulatory T-cell activation signal. The cDNA sequence of CD26 predicts a type II membrane protein with only 6 amino acids in its cytoplasmic region, suggesting that, in addition to DPP-IV enzyme activity, other signal-inducing molecules may be associated with CD26. Considerable evidence exists that CD26 interacts, presumably in its extracellular domain, with both CD45, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, and adenosine deaminase (ADA), each of which is capable of functioning in a signal transduction pathway. In addition, CD26 is the receptor for ADA, and ADA on the cell surface is involved in an important immunoregulatory mechanism by which released ADA binds to the cell-surface ADA. This multifunctional molecule may be involved in cell migration and the HIV-1-associated loss of CD4+ cells through the process of programmed cell death. Thus, CD26 appears to play a key role in a number of aspects of lymphocyte function.},

In this study, we show that SDF-1alpha was cleaved at the N-terminal region by CD26/DPPIV and as a result the inhibitory activity of SDF-1alpha against HIV infection disappeared. Moreover, the chemotactic activity of SDF-1alpha also disappeared specifically by DPPIV activity of recombinant soluble CD26. These results suggested that dissemination of T-tropic HIV strains in vivo may be facilitated by CD26/DPPIV via inactivation of functional SDF-1alpha.},

Natural forms of the C-X-C chemokine granulocyte chemotactic protein-2 (GCP-2) and the C-C chemokine regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted (RANTES), which miss two NH2-terminal residues, including a Pro in the penultimate position, have been isolated from leukocytes or tumor cells. In chemotaxis and intracellular calcium mobilization assays, the truncation caused a reduction in the specific activity of RANTES but not of GCP-2. The serine protease CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV) could induce this observed NH2-terminal truncation of GCP-2 and RANTES but not that of the monocyte chemotactic proteins MCP-1, MCP-2 and MCP-3. No significant difference in neutrophil activation was detected between intact and CD26/DPP IV-truncated GCP-2. In contrast to intact natural RANTES(1-68), which still chemoattracts monocytes at 10 ng/ml, CD26/DPP IV-truncated RANTES(3-68) was inactive at 300 ng/ml and behaved as a natural chemotaxis inhibitor. Compared with intact RANTES, only a 10-fold higher concentration of RANTES(3-68) induced a significant Ca2+ response. Furthermore, RANTES(3-68) inhibited infection of mononuclear cells by an M-tropic HIV-1 strain 5-fold more efficiently than intact RANTES. Thus, proteolytic processing of RANTES by CD26/DPP IV may constitute an important regulatory mechanism during anti-inflammatory and antiviral responses.},

In this paper the 5'-flanking region of the DPPIV gene containing the promoter was sequenced and functionally characterized. The porcine DPPIV promoter lacks a consensus TATA-box, but contains two TATA-like sequences. Evidence for multiple transcription initiation sites was found. Different deletion constructs of the DPPIV 5'-flanking region in front of the CAT gene were analyzed for transient CAT-expression after transfection of the intestinal Caco-2 cell line. These experiments showed that a 89 base pair construct (-91 to -3 relative to the translation initiation site) is sufficient for promoter activity. In the reverse orientation this construct also stimulates transcription with a similar effectivity indicating that the DPPIV promoter has a bidirectional function. The bidirectional function was further demonstrated by the introduction of the -91 to -3 construct into the bidirectional vector system pLUC/CAT-3. In the hepatoma cell line HepG2 two selected deletion constructs (-857 to -3; -282 to -3) were analyzed in the normal orientation using the CAT gene as a reporter gene. The transfection experiments showed that deletion of the region -857 to -282 raised the promoter activity 3-fold. The GC-rich 5'-flanking region was further analyzed and we demonstrate that the DPPIV promoter contains a region with the characteristics of an unmethylated CpG island.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a leukocyte-activation antigen that is expressed on T lymphocytes and macrophages and possesses dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity, whose natural substrates have not been identified yet. CXC chemokines, stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF-1alpha) and 1beta (SDF-1beta), sharing the receptor CXCR-4, are highly efficacious chemoattractants for resting lymphocytes and CD34(+) progenitor cells, and they efficiently block the CXCR-4-mediated entry into cells of T cell line tropic strains of HIV type 1 (HIV-1). Here we show that both the chemotactic and antiviral activities of these chemokines are abrogated by DPPIV-mediated specific removal of the N-terminal dipeptide, not only when the chemokines are produced in transformed mouse L cell line to express human CD26 but also when they were exposed to a human T cell line (H9) physiologically expressing CD26. Mutagenesis of SDF-1alpha confirmed the critical requirement of the N-terminal dipeptide for its chemotactic and antiviral activities. These data suggest that CD26-mediated cleavage of SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta likely occurs in human bodies and promotes HIV-1 replication and disease progression. They may also explain why memory function of CD4(+) cells is preferentially lost in HIV-1 infection. Furthermore, CD26 would modulate various other biological processes in which SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta are involved.},

   abstract = {The functionality of DPP-IV, purified from human placenta and isolated from CD4+/CD26+ T cells of noninfected and HIV-1-infected individuals, was investigated as to its ability to bind certain specific peptides. Using isoelectric focusing and the specificity of substrate-impregnated overlay membranes, we found that DPP-IV from term placenta and from T cells of HIV-infected individuals was significantly more sialylated compared with enzyme isozyme patterns of other tissues. We report here that (1) the number of isoforms of DPP-IV and extent of sialylation are critical to function and peptide binding; (2) the number of sialylated isoforms isolated from PBMCs increases significantly with age greater than 40 years; (3) hypersialylation by extreme anionic isoforms is highly associated with HIV infection and pathognomonic to remaining CD4+ cells in overt AIDS; and (4) highly sialylated DPP-IV is more significantly inhibited by Tat and cationic peptides. We conclude that hypersialylation of DPP-IV modifies surface charge of the CD26 antigen, promoting binding of HIV peptides through their cationic domains to the sialic acid residues of DPP-IV, and that certain HIV moieties are likely to engage this phenomenon as an auxiliary adhesion mechanism to fuse with cells. Furthermore, as a consequence of this occurrence, DPP-IV enzymatic activity can be significantly reduced, competitively.},

Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) attracts monocytes, dendritic cells, activated lymphocytes, and NK cells and has reportedly anti-HIV-1 activity. Here we report that truncation of MDC by deletion of two NH2-terminal residues resulted in impaired binding to CC chemokine receptor (CCR)4, the only identified MDC receptor sofar. Truncated MDC(3-69) failed to desensitize calcium mobilization by MDC(1-69) or thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine (TARC), another CCR4 ligand. MDC(3-69) lacked HUT-78 T cell chemotactic activity but retained its capacity to attract monocytes and to desensitize chemotaxis. Compared with MDC(1-69), MDC(3-69) had weak but enhanced antiviral activity against M- and T-tropic HIV-1 strains. Furthermore, both MDC forms failed to signal through the orphan receptors Bonzo/STRL33 and BOB/GPR15 and to desensitize RANTES and stromal cell-derived factor (SDF)-1 responses in CCR5-transfected and CXC chemokine receptor (CXCR)4-transfected cells, respectively. These findings suggest that MDC recognizes another, yet unidentified, receptor. We conclude that minimal NH2-terminal truncation of MDC differentially affects its various immunologic functions.},

   abstract = {We originally isolated LECT2 (leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2) as a 16-kDa secreted protein having a human neutrophil chemotactic activity, then cloned human and bovine LECT2 cDNAs and demonstrated the liver-specific expression of the protein. LECT2 is thought to be a multifunctional protein, because it was recently found to be identical to chondromodulin-II a growth stimulator of chondrocyte cells. We report here the cloning and the structural analysis of the human LECT2 gene. The gene spans approximately 8 kb and consists of four exons and three introns. Primer extension analysis revealed that several transcription initiation sites occur within 70-230 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon. Several transcriptional control sequences relevant to the liver-specific expression have been identified at the 5' untranslated region of the human LECT2 gene. The human LECT2 gene was mapped to chromosome 5q31.1-q32 by fluorescence in situ hybridization. This region contains a cluster of cytokine genes including IL-4, IL-5, and IL-9.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is an atypical serine protease that modifies the biological activities of certain chemokines and neuropeptides. In addition, human DPPIV, also known as the T-cell activation antigen CD26, binds adenosine deaminase (ADA) to the T-cell surface, thus protecting the T-cell from adenosine-mediated inhibition of proliferation. Mutations were engineered into DPPIV (five point, 16 single point and six deletion mutations) to examine the binding of ADA and 19 monoclonal antibodies. Deletions of C-terminal residues from the 738-residue extracellular portion of DPPIV showed that the 214 residues C-terminal to Ser552 were not required for ADA binding and that peptidase activity could be ablated by deletion of 20 residues from the C-terminus. Point mutations at either of two locations, Leu294 and Val341, ablated ADA binding. Binding by six anti-DPPIV antibodies that inhibited ADA binding was found to require Leu340 to Arg343 and Thr440/Lys441 but not the 214 residues C-terminal to Ser552. The 13 other antibodies studied bound to a truncated DPPIV consisting of amino acids 1-356. Therefore, the binding sites on DPPIV of ADA and antibodies that inhibit ADA binding are discontinuous and overlapping. Moreover, the 47 and 97 residue spacing of amino acids in these binding sites concords with their location on a beta propeller fold consisting of repeated beta sheets of about 50 amino acids.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: The potent incretin hormone glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) plays a pivotal role in prandial insulin secretion. In the circulation GLP-1 (7-36) amide is, however, rapidly (t(1/2):1-2 min) inactivated by the protease dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). We therefore investigated whether DPP-IV inhibition is a feasible approach to improve glucose homeostasis in insulin resistant, glucose intolerant fatty Zucker rats, a model of mild Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. METHODS: An oral glucose tolerance test was done in lean and obese male Zucker rats while plasma DPP-IV was inhibited by the specific and selective inhibitor NVP-DPP728 given orally. RESULTS: Inhibition of DPP-IV resulted in a significantly amplified early phase of the insulin response to an oral glucose load in obese fa/fa rats and restoration of glucose excursions to normal. In contrast, DPP-IV inhibition produced only minor effects in lean FA/? rats. Inactivation of GLP-1 (7-36) amide was completely prevented by DPP-IV inhibition suggesting that the effects of this compound on oral glucose tolerance are mediated by increased circulating concentrations of GLP-1 (7-36) amide. Reduced gastric emptying, as monitored by paracetamol appearance in the circulation after an oral bolus, did not appear to have contributed to the reduced glucose excursion. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: It is concluded that NVP-DPP728 inhibits DPP-IV and improves insulin secretion and glucose tolerance, probably through augmentation of the effects of endogenous GLP-1. The improvement observed in prandial glucose homeostasis during DPP-IV inhibition suggests that inhibition of this enzyme is a promising treatment for Type II diabetes.

Using two-colour immunofluorescence analysis with CD26 and CD20 or CD23 monoclonal antibodies, CD26 was found undetectable on peripheral resting B-cells (CD20+ CD23-) from normal donors whereas it was expressed on B-cells activated in vitro with interleukin (IL)-4 and Staphylococcus aureus strain cowan I (CD20+ CD23+). The expression of CD26 on leukaemic B-cells (CD20+ CD23+) was clearly induced in 22 out of 25 patients examined. Consequently, induced levels of CD26 cell surface expression on either normal activated and malignant B-cells coincided with the enhancement of DPP IV activity detected on the surface of these cells. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analyses showed that the transcript levels of the CD26 gene was higher in normal activated B-cells and B-CLL cells than in resting B-cells, suggesting that CD26 was expressed at the level of transcriptional activation. These observations provide evidence of the abnormal expression of DPPIV/CD26 in B-CLL which, therefore, may be considered as a novel marker for B-CLL. Further investigation in relation to CD26 expression and other B malignancies needs to be defined.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) has recently been shown to be a potent enterotrophic factor that may mediate mucosal hyperplasia during intestinal adaptation. The intestinal brush-border protease dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) cleaves GLP-2 to an inactive form. It has been postulated that DPP IV activity limits the enterotrophic activity of GLP-2 in rats and humans. Massive small bowel resection (MSBR) in rats is an animal model of intestinal adaptation that has been used successfully to characterize factors involved in the modulation of adaptation. METHODS: Total RNA was extracted from normal terminal ileum or terminal ileum post-MSBR from Sprague-Dawley rats which were sacrificed 2, 4, and 7 days postresection. A partial rat DPP IV clone was isolated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, and Northern blot analysis of rat DPP IV mRNA levels in normal small bowel and small bowel post-MSBR was performed. RESULTS: Within normal small bowel, DPP IV mRNA levels were greatest in the terminal ileum; levels in the duodenum and jejunum were approximately 50% of those in the terminal ileum. DPP IV mRNA levels decreased in terminal ileum post-MSBR 2, 4, and 7 days after resection. CONCLUSION: The decreased DPPIV gene expression suggests a novel mechanism by which the effects on mucosal growth of GLP-2 may be further enhanced, and further that GLP-2 may be a more useful therapeutic agent in humans than currently anticipated.},

Functional analysis of the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 site was performed with two minimal dipeptidyl peptidase IV promoter constructs (-250 to -41, and -150 to -41) with and without a 3 bp mutation in the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 sequence, and used in transient transfection experiments with Caco-2 cells. The results show that the mutated constructs were able to drive transcription at only 5-10% of the activity of the non-mutated controls. Co-transfection of 3T3 cells with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 (alpha or beta) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV promoter constructs (-250 to -41 or -150 to -41) resulted in a 2.5-6-fold increase in transcription over controls with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 alpha but not with hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 beta. The results of this study show that hepatocyte nuclear factor 1 binds to the -150 to -131 region of the human dipeptidyl peptidase IV promoter and is necessary for transcriptional activation of the gene for dipeptidyl peptidase IV.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell surface-bound protease of the prolyl oligopeptidase gene family expressed at sites of tissue remodelling. This study aimed to delineate the expression of FAP in cirrhotic human liver and examine its biochemical activities. Seventeen cirrhotic and 8 normal liver samples were examined by immunohistochemistry and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Hepatic stellate cells (HSC) were isolated and immunostained. Recombinant FAP and immunopurified, natural FAP were analyzed for protease activities and similarities to dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), a structurally related enzyme. FAP-specific messenger RNA and immunoreactivity were detected in cirrhotic, but not normal, livers. FAP immunoreactivity was most intense on perisinusoidal cells of the periseptal regions within regenerative nodules (15 of 15 cases); this pattern coincides with the tissue remodelling interface. In addition, human FAP was expressed by cells within the fibrous septa (10 of 15 cases). Cell morphology, location, and colocalization with glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) indicated that FAP is present on HSC in vivo. Similarly, isolated HSC expressed FAP in vitro. Both natural FAP from cirrhotic liver and recombinant FAP were shown to have gelatinase and dipeptidyl peptidase activities. FAP is a cell-bound, dual-specificity dipeptidyl peptidase and gelatinase expressed by activated HSC at the tissue remodelling interface in human cirrhosis. FAP may contribute to the HSC-induced extracellular matrix (ECM) changes of cirrhosis.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP IV/CD26) has a dual function as a regulatory protease and as a binding protein. Its role in the inactivation of bioactive peptides was recognized 20 years ago due to its unique ability to liberate Xaa–Pro or Xaa–Ala dipeptides from the N-terminus of regulatory peptides, but further examples are now emerging from in vitro and vivo experiments. Despite the minimal N-terminal truncation by DPP IV, many mammalian regulatory peptides are inactivated — either totally or only differentially — for certain receptor subtypes. Important DPP IV substrates include neuropeptides like neuropeptide Y or endomorphin, circulating peptide hormones like peptide YY, growth hormone-releasing hormone, glucagon-like peptides(GLP)-1 and -2, gastric inhibitory polypeptide as well as paracrine chemokines like RANTES (regulated on activation normal T cell expressed and secreted), stromal cell-derived factor, eotaxin and macrophage-derived chemokine. Based on these findings the potential clinical uses of selective DPP IV inhibitors or DPP IV-resistant analogues, especially for the insulinotropic hormone GLP-1, have been tested to enhance insulin secretion and to improve glucose tolerance in diabetic animals. Thus, DPP IV appears to be a major physiological regulator for some regulatory peptides, neuropeptides, circulating hormones and chemokines.},

   abstract = {In 1970, Erspamer et al.1,14isolated and characterized the tetradecapeptide bombesin (BN) from the skin of amphibian frog Bombina bombina. Subsequently, several BN-like peptides have been identified in mammals, consisting of various forms of gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) and/or neuromedin B (NMB), together with their distinct receptor subtypes. It has been proposed that BN-related peptides may be released from the gastrointestinal (GI)-tract in response to ingested food, and that they bridge the gut and brain (through neurocrine means) to inhibit further food intake. Conversely, the suppression of release of BN-like peptides at relevant brain nuclei may signal the initiation of a feeding episode. The present review will describe recent pharmacological, molecular, behavioral and physiological experiments, supporting the contention that endogenous BN-related peptides do indeed influence ingestive behaviors. Particular attention is focused on the relationship between these peptides in the peripheral compartment and their impact on central circuits using GRP and/or NMB as transmitters. In addition, however, we will point out various caveats and conundrums that preclude unequivocal conclusions about the precise role(s) of these peptides and their mechanism(s) of action. We conclude that BN-related peptides play an important role in the control of food intake, and may contribute to ingestive disruptions associated with anorexia (anorexia nervosa, AIDS and cancer anorexia), bulimia, obesity and depression. Hence, pharmacological targeting of these systems may be of therapeutic value.},

   abstract = {CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a cell surface ectoenzyme which participates in immune and inflammatory reactions. We found that CD26 was only partially expressed on human fibroblasts from periodontal tissues, whereas fibroblasts from lung and skin expressed CD26 constitutively as revealed by flow cytometry. We examined the possible upregulation of CD26 expression on human gingival fibroblasts in response to various stimulants. Interleukin-1alpha (IL-1alpha); tumor necrosis factor alpha; gamma interferon; lipopolysaccharide from Porphyromonas gingivalis, Prevotella intermedia, and Escherichia coli; and Prevotella glycoprotein augmented CD26 expression on gingival fibroblasts. Among the stimulants, IL-1alpha exhibited the most potent activity. Enzymatic activity of CD26 induced by IL-1alpha on fibroblasts was determined colorimetrically in terms of Gly-Pro hydrolysis of a synthetic chromogenic substrate, Gly-Pro p-nitroanilide. Among various inhibitors tested, diprotin A and phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride inhibited the enzymatic activity, suggesting that the enzyme induced by IL-1alpha was DPPIV. The upregulation of CD26 mRNA expression upon stimulation with IL-1alpha was also revealed by a quantitative reverse transcription-PCR assay. In the kinetic experiment, 48 h and several days were required for maximum CD26 mRNA accumulation and CD26 molecule expression on the cell surface, respectively. The addition of cycloheximide at 2 h before IL-1alpha stimulation almost completely inhibited the accumulation of CD26 mRNA. These results suggested that induction of CD26 on human gingival fibroblasts is regulated at the transcriptional level and is also dependent on a de novo-synthesized protein factor(s).},

   abstract = {Chemokines play diverse roles in inflammatory and non-inflammatory situations via activation of heptahelical G-protein-coupled receptors. Also, many chemokine receptors can act as cofactors for cellular entry of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)in vitro. CCR5, a receptor for chemokines MIP-1α (LD78α), MIP-1β, RANTES, and MCP2, is of particular importancein vivo as polymorphisms in this gene affect HIV infection and rate of progression to AIDS. Moreover, the CCR5 ligands can prevent HIV entry through this receptor and likely contribute to the control of HIV infection. Here we show that a non-allelic isoform of human MIP-1α (LD78α), termed LD78β or MIP-1αP, has enhanced receptor binding affinities to CCR5 (∼6-fold) and the promiscuous β-chemokine receptor, D6 (∼15–20-fold). We demonstrate that a proline residue at position 2 of MIP-1αP is responsible for this enhanced activity. Moreover, MIP-1αP is by far the most potent natural CCR5 agonist described to date, and importantly, displays markedly higher HIV1 suppressive activity than all other human MIP-1α isoforms examined. In addition, while RANTES has been described as the most potent inhibitor of CCR5-mediated HIV entry, MIP-1αP was as potent as, if not more potent than, RANTES in HIV-1 suppressive assays. This property suggests that MIP-1αP may be of importance in controlling viral spread in HIV-infected individuals.},

   abstract = {Proteolytic degradation of extracellular matrix (ECM) components during tissue remodeling plays a pivotal role in normal and pathological processes including wound healing, inflammation, tumor invasion, and metastasis. Proteolytic enzymes in tumors may activate or release growth factors from the ECM or act directly on the ECM itself, thereby facilitating angiogenesis or tumor cell migration. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a cell surface antigen of reactive tumor stromal fibroblasts found in epithelial cancers and in granulation tissue during wound healing. It is absent from most normal adult human tissues. FAP is conserved throughout chordate evolution, with homologues in mouse and Xenopus laevis, whose expression correlates with tissue remodeling events. Using recombinant and purified natural FAP, we show that FAP has both dipeptidyl peptidase activity and a collagenolytic activity capable of degrading gelatin and type I collagen; by sequence, FAP belongs to the serine protease family rather than the matrix metalloprotease family. Mutation of the putative catalytic serine residue of FAP to alanine abolishes both enzymatic activities. Consistent with its in vivo expression pattern determined by immunohistochemistry, FAP enzyme activity was detected by an immunocapture assay in human cancerous tissues but not in matched normal tissues. This study demonstrates that FAP is present as an active cell surface-bound collagenase in epithelial tumor stroma and opens up investigation into physiological substrates of its novel, tumor-associated dipeptidyl peptidase activity.},

In some approaches, the experimental data are peptide molecular weights from the digestion of a protein by an enzyme. Other approaches use tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data from one or more peptides. Still others combine mass data with amino acid sequence data. We present results from a new computer program, Mascot, which integrates all three types of search. The scoring algorithm is probability based, which has a number of advantages: (i) A simple rule can be used to judge whether a result is significant or not. This is particularly useful in guarding against false positives. (ii) Scores can be compared with those from other types of search, such as sequence homology. (iii) Search parameters can be readily optimised by iteration. The strengths and limitations of probability-based scoring are discussed, particularly in the context of high throughput, fully automated protein identification.},

   abstract = {The serine protease CD26/dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV) and chemokines are known key players in immunological processes; Surprisingly, CD26/DPP IV not only removed the expected Gly(1)-Pro(2) dipeptide from the NH(2) terminus of macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) but subsequently also the Tyr(3)-Gly(4) dipeptide, generating MDC(5-69). This second cleavage after a Gly residue demonstrated that the substrate specificity of this protease is less restricted than anticipated. The unusual processing of MDC by CD26/DPP TV was confirmed on the synthetic peptides GPYGANMED (MDC(1-9)) and YGANMED (MDC(3-9)). Compared with intact MDC(1-69), CD26/DPP IV-processed MDC(5-69) had reduced chemotactic activity on lymphocytes and monocyte-derived dendritic cells, showed impaired mobilization of intracellular Ca(2+) through CC chemokine receptor 4 (CCR4), and was unable to desensitize for MDC-induced Ca(2+)-responses in CCR4 transfectants. However, MDC(5-69) remained equally chemotactic as intact MDC(1-69) on monocytes. In contrast to the reduced binding to lymphocytes and CCR4 transfectants, MDC(5-69) retained its binding properties to monocytes and its anti-HIV-l activity. Thus, NH(2)-terminal truncation of MDC by CD26/DPP TV has profound biological consequences and may be an important regulatory mechanism during the migration of Th2 lymphocytes and dendritic cells to germinal centers and to sites of inflammation.},

   abstract = {The tetrapeptide, endomorphin-2 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-PheNH2) possesses high affinity for mu opioid receptors, and produces potent analgesia in mice. Its structure appears to satisfy the substrate requirements of the proteinase, dipeptidyl peptidase IV which removes dipeptides from the amino terminus of peptides containing proline as the penultimate amino acid. A potent, stable and specific inhibitor of this enzyme, Ala-Pyrrolidonyl-2-nitrile, has been described which should potentiate endomorphin-2-induced analgesia. Further, since dipeptidyl peptidase IV has an absolute requirement for l-Pro, a more metabolically-stable d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 analog should produce longer analgesic actions at lower doses. The present study found that endomorphin-2 was degraded approximately twice as fast than the chromogenic substrate, Ala-Pro-2naphthylamide, by dipeptidyl peptidase IV, whereas d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 was totally resistant to this enzyme's action. d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 (ED50=0.05 microg) was more potent than endomorphin-2 (ED50=30 microg) in significantly increasing tail-flick latencies with longer durations of action. Both the peptide and analogue were equipotent (ED50=0.5 microg) in significantly increasing jump thresholds. Ala-Pyrrolidonyl-2-nitrile (10-75 nmol) elicited a dose-dependent analgesia, and potentiated the analgesic actions of endomorphin-2, particularly on the tail-flick test. Whereas systemic naltrexone (2.5, 10 mg/kg) dose-dependently eliminated each of the three forms of analgesia on the jump test as well as the peak (15 min) effect on the tail-flick test, analgesia elicited by either endomorphin-2, d-Pro2-endomorphin-2 or Ala-Pyrrolidonyl-2-nitrile returned after 30-60 min in naltrexone-treated rats on the tail-flick test. These data strongly suggest that dipeptidyl peptidase IV plays a role in the inactivation of endomorphin-2 in vivo, and thereby modulates its central analgesic actions.},

   abstract = {Chemokines attract and activate distinct sets of leukocytes. The CC chemokine eotaxin has been characterized as an important mediator in allergic reactions because it selectively attracts eosinophils, Th2 lymphocytes, and basophils. Human eotaxin has a penultimate proline, indicating that it might be a substrate for dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV). In this study we demonstrate that eotaxin is efficiently cleaved by CD26/DPP IV and that the NH2-terminal truncation affects its biological activity. CD26/DPP IV-truncated eotaxin(3-74) showed reduced chemotactic activity for eosinophils and impaired binding and signaling properties through the CC chemokine receptor 3. Moreover, eotaxin(3-74) desensitized calcium signaling and inhibited chemotaxis toward intact eotaxin. In addition, HIV-2 infection of CC chemokine receptor 3-transfected cells was inhibited to a similar extent by eotaxin and eotaxin(3-74). Thus, CD26/DPP IV differently regulates the chemotactic and antiviral potencies of eotaxin by the removal of two NH2-terminal residues. This physiological processing may be an important down-regulatory mechanism, limiting eotaxin-mediated inflammatory responses.},

   abstract = {Chemokines and their receptors play a crucial part in the recruitment of leukocytes into inflammatory sites. The CXC chemokines IP-10 and Mig are selective attractants for activated (memory) T cells, the predominant cell type in skin infiltrates in many inflammatory dermatoses. The selectivity for activated T cells can be explained by the fact that both chemokines exert their effects through a common receptor, CXCR3, which is nearly exclusively expressed on activated T cells. The aim of this study was to identify biologically active CXCR3 ligands produced by keratinocytes. To that end, Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing a cDNA encoding CXCR3 were challenged with proteins obtained from interferon-gamma stimulated keratinocytes and subsequently monitored for effects on second messenger systems. By this approach we were able to isolate IP-10 and Mig, and in addition identified a novel highly potent ligand for the CXCR3 receptor, designated interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, which proved to be chemotactic for activated T cells expressing CXCR3. Protein sequence and mass spectrometric analysis followed by molecular cloning of the cDNA encoding interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9, revealed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is a CXC chemokine with a molecular mass of 8303 Da. From a GenBank database query it became clear that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 is in fact the protein encoded by the cDNA sequence also known as beta-R1, H174 or I-TAC. In situ hybridization experiments showed that interferon-gamma-inducible protein-9 mRNA is expressed by basal layer keratinocytes in a variety of skin disorders, including allergic contact dermatitis, lichen planus, and mycosis fungoides suggesting a functional role for this chemokine in skin immune responses.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a cell surface peptidase expressed by normal melanocytes, epithelial cells, and other cells. Malignant cells, including melanomas and carcinomas, frequently lose or alter DPPIV cell surface expression. Loss of DPPIV expression occurs during melanoma progression at a stage where transformed melanocytes become independent of exogenous growth factors for survival. Tetracycline-inducible expression vectors were constructed to express DPPIV in human melanoma cells. Reexpressing DPPIV in melanoma cells at or below levels expressed by normal melanocytes induced a profound change in phenotype that was characteristic of normal melanocytes. DPPIV expression led to a loss of tumorigenicity, anchorage-independent growth, a reversal in a block in differentiation, and an acquired dependence on exogenous growth factors for cell survival. Suppression of tumorigenicity and reversal of a block in differentiation were dependent on serine protease activity, assessed using mutant DPPIV molecules containing serine-->alanine substitutions. Surprisingly, dependence on exogenous growth factors was not dependent on serine protease activity. Reexpression of either wild-type or mutant DPPIV rescued expression of a second putative cell surface serine peptidase, fibroblast activation protein alpha, which can form a heterodimer with DPPIV. This observation suggests that rescue of fibroblast activation protein alpha may play a role in regulating growth of melanocytic cells. These results support the view that downregulation of DPPIV is an important early event in the pathogenesis of melanoma.},

Suitable analytical procedures were developed involving the use of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography for purification of the enzymatic degradation products and a peptide mapping procedure for evaluating the enzymatic degradation of the large precursor protein chromogranin A. While vasostatin I was found to be a substrate for dipeptidyl peptidase IV, no N-terminal cleavage of Leu-Pro could be noted for chromogranin A. With respect to vasostatin II, N-terminal degradation was only observed after degradation in the C-terminal domain to proteins containing less than or equal to 78 amino acids. The specificity of the N-terminal release of Leu-Pro was proved by addition of a DPP IV specific inhibitor. Copyright (C) 1999 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has been implicated in tumor growth and cirrhosis. Here we describe DPP8, a novel human postproline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase that is homologous to DPPIV and FAP. Northern-blot hybridization showed that the tissue expression of DPP8 mRNA is ubiquitous, similar to that of DPPIV. The DPP8 gene was localized to chromosome 15q22, distinct from a closely related gene at 19p13.3 which we named DPP9. The full-length DPP8 cDNA codes for an 882-amino-acid protein that has about 27% identity and 51% similarity to DPPIV and FAP, but no transmembrane domain and no N-linked or O-linked glycosylation. Western blots and confocal microscopy of transfected COS-7 cells showed DPP8 to be a 100-kDa monomeric protein expressed in the cytoplasm. Purified recombinant DPP8 hydrolyzed the DPPIV substrates Ala-Pro, Arg-Pro and Gly-Pro. Thus recombinant DPP8 shares a postproline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity with DPPIV and FAP. DPP8 enzyme activity had a neutral pH optimum consistent with it being nonlysosomal. The similarities between DPP8 and DPPIV in tissue expression pattern and substrates suggests a potential role for DPP8 in T-cell activation and immune function.},

We have determined the nucleotide sequence of nearly all of the ∼120-megabase euchromatic portion of theDrosophila genome using a whole-genome shotgun sequencing strategy supported by extensive clone-based sequence and a high-quality bacterial artificial chromosome physical map. Efforts are under way to close the remaining gaps; however, the sequence is of sufficient accuracy and contiguity to be declared substantially complete and to support an initial analysis of genome structure and preliminary gene annotation and interpretation. The genome encodes ∼13,600 genes, somewhat fewer than the smaller Caenorhabditis elegansgenome, but with comparable functional diversity.},

   abstract = {CD26 is an ectoenzyme with dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity expressed on a variety of cell types. Although the function of the high concentration of serum-soluble CD26 (sCD26) is unknown, it may be related to the cleavage of biologically active polypeptides. As CD26 or enzymatic activity levels were previously associated with cancer, we examined the potential diagnostic and prognostic value of preoperative sCD26 measurements by ELISA in colorectal carcinoma patients. We found a highly significant difference between sCD26 levels in healthy donors (mean 559.7 +/- 125.5 microg l(-1)) and cancer patients (mean 261.7 +/- 138.1 microg l(-1)) (P< 0.001). A cut-off at 410 microg l(-1)gave 90% sensitivity with 90% specificity which means that the diagnostic efficiency of sCD26 is higher than that shown by other markers, particularly in patients at early stages. Moreover, sCD26 as a variable is not related with Dukes' stage classification, age, gender, tumour location or degree of differentiation. With a follow-up of 2 years until recurrence, preliminary data show that sCD26 can be managed as a prognostic variable of early carcinoma patients. In addition, the origin of sCD26 is discussed.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, EC 3.4.14.5) is a serine type protease with an important modulatory activity on a number of chemokines, neuropeptides and peptide hormones. It is also known as CD26 or adenosine deaminase (ADA; EC 3.5.4.4) binding protein. DPPIV has been demonstrated on the plasmamembranes of T cells and activated natural killer or B cells as well as on a number of endothelial and differentiated epithelial cells. A soluble form of CD26/DPPIV has been described in serum. Over the past few years, several related enzymes with similar dipeptidyl peptidase activity have been discovered, raising questions on the molecular origin(s) of serum dipeptidyl peptidase activity. Among them attractin, the human orthologue of the mouse mahogany protein, was postulated to be responsible for the majority of the DPPIV-like activity in serum. Using ADA-affinity chromatography, it is shown here that 95% of the serum dipeptidyl peptidase activity is associated with a protein with ADA-binding properties. The natural protein was purified in milligram quantities, allowing molecular characterization (N-terminal sequence, glycosylation type, CD-spectrum, pH and thermal stability) and comparison with CD26/DPPIV from other sources. The purified serum enzyme was confirmed as CD26.},

   abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2), an intestinal product of glucagon gene expression which induces intestinal growth in mice, has been proposed as a treatment for intestinal insufficiency. GLP-2 is metabolized extensively by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) in rats, but less is known about its fate in humans. Therefore, GLP-2 metabolism was investigated in healthy volunteers after 1) a 500-Cal mixed meal (n = 6), 2) iv infusion of synthetic human GLP-2 (0.8 pmol/kg x min; n = 8), 3) a sc bolus injection (400 microg; n = 9), and 4) in vitro incubation in plasma and blood (1,000 pmol/L; n = 4). GLP-2 concentrations were determined by N-terminal RIA measuring only intact GLP-2, side-viewing RIA measuring intact and degraded forms [e.g. GLP-2-(3-33) arising from DPP-IV degradation], and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). Meal ingestion elevated plasma GLP-2 (intact, 16 +/- 3 to 73 +/- 10 pmol/L at 90 min), and HPLC revealed two immunoreactive components: intact GLP-2 (57 +/- 2%) and GLP-2-(3-33). GLP-2 infusion increased plasma levels [intact, 9 +/- 4 to 131 +/- 11 pmol/L; total, 23 +/- 7 to 350 +/- 18 pmol/L; the differences represent GLP-2-(3-33)]. The elimination t(1/2) values were 7.2 +/- 2 min (intact GLP-2) and 27.4 +/- 5.4 min [GLP-2-(3-33)], and MCRs were 6.8 +/- 0.6 and 1.9 +/- 0.3 mL/kg x min, respectively. Subcutaneous injection increased intact GLP-2 to maximally 1,493 +/- 250 pmol/L at 45 min, whereas total GLP-2 increased to 2,793 +/- 477 pmol/L at 90 min. At 60 min, plasma contained 69 +/- 1% intact GLP-2. In vitro the t(1/2) values were 8.0 +/- 1.5 h (plasma) and 3.3 +/- 0.3 h (blood). GLP-2-(3-33) was the only degradation product identified by HPLC, and a DPP-IV inhibitor abolished the degradation of GLP-2 in vitro. We conclude that GLP-2 is extensively degraded to GLP-2-(3-33) in humans, presumably by DPP-IV. Nevertheless, 69% remains intact 1 h after GLP-2 injection, supporting the possibility of sc use in patients with intestinal insufficiency.},

   abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) induces intestinal growth in mice; but in normal rats, it seems less potent, possibly because of degradation of GLP-2 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV). The purpose of this study was to investigate the survival and effect of GLP-2 in rats and mice after s.c. injection of GLP-2 with or without the specific DPP-IV inhibitor, valine-pyrrolidide (VP). Rats were injected s.c. with 40 microg GLP-2 or 40 microg GLP-2+15 mg VP. Plasma was collected at different time points and analyzed, by RIA, for intact GLP-2. Rats were treated for 14 days with: saline; 15 mg VP; 40 microg GLP-2, 40 microg GLP-2+15 mg VP; 40 microg GLP-2 (3-33). Mice were treated for 10 days with: saline; 5 microg GLP-2; 5 microg GLP-2+1.5 mg VP; 25 microg GLP-2; 25 microg GLP-2 (3-33). In both cases, body weight, intestinal weight, length, and morphometric data were measured. After s.c. injection, the plasma concentration of GLP-2 reached a maximum after 15 min, and elevated concentrations persisted for 4-8 h. With VP, the concentration of intact GLP-2 was about 2-fold higher for at least the initial 60 min. Rats treated with GLP-2+VP had increased (P < 0.01) small-bowel weight (4.68 +/- 0.11%, relative to body weight), compared with the two control groups, [3.01 +/- 0.06% (VP) and 2.94 +/- 0.07% (NaCl)] and GLP-2 alone (3.52 +/- 0.10%). In mice, the growth effect of 5 microg GLP-2+VP was comparable with that of 25 microg GLP-2. GLP-2 (3-33) had no effect in rats, but it had a weak effect on intestinal growth in mice. The extensive GLP-2 degradation in rats can be reduced by VP, and DPP-IV inhibition markedly enhances the intestinotrophic effect of GLP-2 in both rats and mice. We propose that DPP-IV inhibition may be considered to enhance the efficacy of GLP-2 as a therapeutic agent.},

   abstract = {Over the past decade, numerous studies have been targeted at defining structure-activity relationships of glucagon. Recently, we have found that glucagon(1-29) is hydrolyzed by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) to produce glucagon(3-29) and glucagon(5-29); in human serum, [pyroglutamyl (pGlu)(3)]glucagon(3-29) is formed from glucagon(3-29), and this prevents further hydrolysis of glucagon by DPIV (H.-U. Demuth, K. Glund, U. Heiser, J. Pospisilik, S. Hinke, T. Hoffmann, F. Rosche, D. Schlenzig, M. Wermann, C. McIntosh, and R. Pederson, manuscript in preparation). In the current study, the biological activity of these peptides was examined in vitro. The amino-terminally truncated peptides all behaved as partial agonists in cyclic AMP stimulation assays, with Chinese hamster ovary K1 cells overexpressing the human glucagon receptor (potency: glucagon(1-29) > [pGlu(3)]glu- cagon(3-29) > glucagon(3-29) > glucagon(5-29) > [Glu(9)]glu- cagon(2-29)). In competition binding experiments, [pGlu(3)]glucagon(3-29) and glucagon(5-29) both demonstrated 5-fold lower affinity for the receptor than glucagon(1-29), whereas glucagon(3-29) exhibited 18-fold lower affinity. Of the peptides tested, only glucagon(5-29) showed antagonist activity, and this was weak compared with the classical glucagon antagonist, [Glu(9)]glucagon(2-29). Hence, DPIV hydrolysis of glucagon yields low affinity agonists of the glucagon receptor. As a corollary to evidence indicating that DPIV degrades glucagon (Demuth, et al., manuscript in preparation), DPIV-resistant analogs were synthesized. Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry was used to assess DPIV resistance, and it allowed kinetic analysis of degradation. Of several analogs generated, only [D-Ser(2)] and [Gly(2)]glucagon retained high affinity binding and biological potency, similar to native glucagon in vitro. [D-Ser(2)]Glucagon exhibited enhanced hyperglycemic activity in a bioassay, whereas [Gly(2)]glucagon was not completely resistant to DPIV degradation.},

   abstract = {Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a ubiquitous neuropeptide of the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) family that potentiates glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Pancreatic beta cells express two PACAP receptor subtypes, a PACAP-preferring (PAC1) and a VIP-shared (VPAC2) receptor. We have applied a gene targeting approach to create a mouse lacking the PAC1 receptor (PAC1(-/-)). These mice were viable and normoglycemic, but exhibited a slight feeding hyperinsulinemia. In vitro, in the isolated perfused pancreas, the insulin secretory response to PACAP was reduced by 50% in PAC1(-/-) mice, whereas the response to VIP was unaffected. In vivo, the insulinotropic action of PACAP was also acutely reduced, and the peptide induced impairment of glucose tolerance after an intravenous glucose injection. This demonstrates that PAC1 receptor is involved in the insulinotropic action of the peptide. Moreover, PAC1(-/-) mice exhibited reduced glucose-stimulated insulin secretion in vitro and in vivo, showing that the PAC1 receptor is required to maintain normal insulin secretory responsiveness to glucose. The defective insulinotropic action of glucose was associated with marked glucose intolerance after both intravenous and gastric glucose administration. Thus, these results are consistent with a physiological role for the PAC1 receptor in glucose homeostasis, notably during food intake.},

   abstract = {SK&F 107647, a previously described synthetic immunomodulatory peptide, indirectly stimulates bone marrow progenitor cells and phagocytic cells, and enhances host defense effector mechanisms in bacterial and fungal infection models in vivo. In vitro, SK&F 107647 induces the production of a soluble mediator that augments colony forming cell (CFU-GM) formation in the presence of CSFs. In this paper we purified and sequenced the stromal cell-derived hematopoietic synergistic factors (HSF) secreted from both murine and human cell lines stimulated with SK&F 107647. Murine HSF is an N-terminal 4-aa truncated form of the CXC chemokine, KC, while human HSF was identified as an N-terminal 4-aa truncated form of the CXC chemokine, GRO beta. In comparison to their full-length forms, truncated KC and truncated GRO beta were 10 million times more potent as synergistic growth stimulants for CFU-GM. Enhanced potency of these novel truncated chemokines relative to their full-length forms was also demonstrated in respiratory burst assays, CD11b Ag expression, and intracellular killing of the opportunistic pathogen, Candida albicans. Administration of truncated KC significantly enhanced survival of mice lethally infected with C. albicans. The results reported herein delineate the biological mechanism of action of SK&F 107647, which functions via the induction of unique specific truncated forms of the chemokines KC and GRO beta. To our knowledge, this represents the first example where any form of KC or GRO beta were purified from marrow stromal cells. Additionally, this is the first demonstration of in vivo efficacy of a CXC chemokine in an animal infectious fungal disease model.},

   abstract = {Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC) is a CC chemokine paradigmatic of emerging aspects of chemokine immunobiology. It is constitutively expressed, yet microbial products and cytokines regulate its expression with divergent effects of type II (IL-4 and IL-13) and type I (interferon) cytokines. Processing of the mature protein by dipeptidyl peptidase IV/CD26 provides a further level of regulation. It acts on diverse cellular targets including dendritic cells (DC), NK cells, and T cell subsets. Among these, MDC is a potent attractant for CCR4 expressing polarized Th2 and Tc2 cells, and evidence is consistent with a role of this chemokine as an amplification loop of polarized type II responses. Emerging indications on the involvement of MDC in diverse pathologies, ranging from allergic reactions to HIV infection and neoplasia, are discussed.},

   abstract = {A subset of prolyl oligopeptidases, including dipeptidyl-peptidase IV (DPP IV or CD26, EC ), specifically cleave off N-terminal dipeptides from substrates having proline or alanine in amino acid position 2. This enzyme activity has been implicated in the regulation of the biological activity of multiple hormones and chemokines, including the insulinotropic peptides glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). Targeted inactivation of the CD26 gene yielded healthy mice that have normal blood glucose levels in the fasted state, but reduced glycemic excursion after a glucose challenge. Levels of glucose-stimulated circulating insulin and the intact insulinotropic form of GLP-1 are increased in CD26(-/-) mice. A pharmacological inhibitor of DPP IV enzymatic activity improved glucose tolerance in wild-type, but not in CD26(-/-), mice. This inhibitor also improved glucose tolerance in GLP-1 receptor(-/-) mice, indicating that CD26 contributes to blood glucose regulation by controlling the activity of GLP-1 as well as additional substrates. These data reveal a critical role for CD26 in physiological glucose homeostasis, and establish it as a potential target for therapy in type II diabetes.},

Homologues of FAP have been identified in the mouse and Xenopus laevis. FAP is a dual-specificity enzyme that acts as a dipeptidyl peptidase and collagenase in vitro. To explore the role of FAP in vivo, Fap(−/−) mice were generated by homologous recombination. RNase protection analysis and reverse transcription-PCR confirmed the absence of full-length Fap transcripts in mouse embryonic tissues. No FAP protein was detected in Fap(−/−) animals by immunohistochemistry, and no FAP-specific dipeptidyl peptidase activity was found. We report that Fap(−/−) mice are fertile, show no overt developmental defects, and have no general change in cancer susceptibility.},

   abstract = {Proteomics, the large-scale analysis of proteins, will contribute greatly to our understanding of gene function in the post-genomic era. Proteomics can be divided into three main areas: (1) protein micro-characterization for large-scale identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications; (2) 'differential display' proteomics for comparison of protein levels with potential application in a wide range of diseases; and (3) studies of protein-protein interactions using techniques such as mass spectrometry or the yeast two-hybrid system. Because it is often difficult to predict the function of a protein based on homology to other proteins or even their three-dimensional structure, determination of components of a protein complex or of a cellular structure is central in functional analysis. This aspect of proteomic studies is perhaps the area of greatest promise. After the revolution in molecular biology exemplified by the ease of cloning by DNA methods, proteomics will add to our understanding of the biochemistry of proteins, processes and pathways for years to come.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a 110-kD, trans-membrane, ectoenzyme, with ubiquitous expression. DPPIV has numerous functions including involvement in T-cell activation, cell adhesion, digestion of proline containing peptides in the kidney and intestines, HIV infection and apoptosis, and regulation of tumorigenicity in certain melanoma cells. Constitutively expressed on numerous epithelial cell types, DPPIV is often disregulated in a variety of human malignancies. The most striking evidence of DPPIV down-regulation is found in transformed melanocytes. where nearly 100% of melanomas lack DPPIV expression. We have identified DPPIV as a gene that can alter the invasive potential of a number of melanoma cell lines. By transfecting the full-length cDNA of DPPIV, we have established stable melanoma cell lines that express comparable levels of the DPPIV protein as normal epidermal melanocytes. Matrigel invasion assays were utilized to study the effects of DPPIV expression on the invasive potential of these cells. The parental and vector transfectants readily migrated across the Matrigel while the invasiveness of DPPIV transfected cells was reduced by greater than 75%. The effects on cellular invasion are not attributed to overall growth characteristics, as both DPPIV expressing and non-expressing cells behave comparably in culture. We have also constructed mutants of DPPIV that lack either the extra-cellular serine protease activity or the six amino acid cytoplasmic domain. Both mutants were stably expressed in melanoma cells. Matrigel invasion assays performed with cells expressing the two mutant forms of the protein revealed phenotypic effects similar to wild type function. In this study. we have demonstrated that expression of a proteolytically active form of the DPPIV protein inhibits the invasiveness of malignant melanoma cell lines lacking endogenous DPPIV expression. Furthermore, we have shown that neither the protease activity nor the cytoplasmic domain of DPPIV is required for its anti-invasive activity.},

Knowledge held in local sources can be transformed into a common constraint language, and fused with knowledge from other sources. The fused knowledge is then used to solve some problem or deliver some information to a user. Problem solving in KRAFT typically exploits pre-existing constraint solvers. KRAFT uses an open and flexible agent architecture in which knowledge sources, knowledge fusing entities and users are all represented by independent KRAFT agents, communicating using a messaging protocol. Facilitator agents perform matchmaking and brokerage services between the various kinds of agent. KRAFT is being applied to an example application in the domain of network data services design.},

   abstract = {Chemokines are proinflammatory cytokines that play a role in leukocyte migration and activation. Recent reports showed that RANTES (regulated on activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted chemokine), eotaxin, macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC), and stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) are NH(2)-terminally truncated by the lymphocyte surface glycoprotein and protease CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (CD26/DPP IV). Removal of the NH(2)-terminal dipeptide resulted in impaired inflammatory properties of RANTES, eotaxin, MDC, and SDF-1. The potential CD26/DPP IV substrate macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta (MIP-1beta) and the related chemokine, LD78alpha (ie, one of the MIP-1alpha isoforms), were not affected by this protease. However, CD26/DPP IV cleaved LD78beta, a most potent CCR5 binding chemokine and inhibitor of macrophage tropic human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection, into LD78beta(3-70). Naturally truncated LD78beta(3-70), but not truncated MIP-1beta, was recovered as an abundant chemokine form from peripheral blood mononuclear cells. In contrast to all other chemokines processed by CD26/DPP IV, LD78beta(3-70) had increased chemotactic activity in comparison to intact LD78beta. With a minimal effective concentration of 30 pmol/L, LD78beta(3-70) became the most efficient monocyte chemoattractant. LD78beta(3-70) retained its high capacity to induce an intracellular calcium increase in CCR5-transfected cells. Moreover, on CCR1 transfectants, truncated LD78beta(3-70) was 30-fold more potent than intact LD78beta. Thus, CD26/DPP IV can exert not only a negative but also a positive feedback during inflammation by increasing the specific activity of LD78beta. CD26/DPP IV-cleaved LD78beta(3-70) is the most potent CCR1 and CCR5 agonist that retains strong anti-HIV-1 activity, indicating the importance of the chemokine-protease interaction in normal and pathologic conditions.

   abstract = {N-terminal sequence analysis by Edman chemistry continues to play an important role in the structural analysis of proteins and peptides. Improvements in the sensitivity of the method have been achieved mainly at the level of increasing the sensitivity of the on-line analysis of PTH amino acids by RP-HPLC (reverse phase high performance chromatography). Using microbore columns (0.8-1.0 mm), it is possible to run standards at the 0.5-1.0 pmol level and to sequence samples in the 1-5 pmol range. Due to constraints in current chromatographic methods, it is unlikely that further improvements in sensitivity will be achieved by this approach alone. Although alternative Edman reagents, including fluorescent chemistries, have promised to increase the sensitivity of sequencing into the low femtomole range, none of the methods have progressed into routine usage. These reagents and chemistries are critically evaluated in this review, and the problems which have prevented their further development discussed. Instrumental constraints are also considered. It is concluded that the development of more sensitive methods requires further research into both the chemistry and the instrumentation, and that alternative separation and detection methods may also play a role.},

These "cerebral proteopathies" include Alzheimer's disease (AD), Parkinson's disease (PD), Huntington's disease (HD), prion diseases, and a variety of other disorders. Evidence is accumulating that the anomalous aggregation of the proteins, and not a loss of protein function, is central to the pathogenesis of these diseases. Thus, therapeutic strategies that reduce the production, accumulation, or polymerization of pathogenic proteins might be applicable to a wide range of some of the most devastating diseases of old age.},

   abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a recently characterized intestine-derived peptide that exerts trophic activity in the small and large intestine. Whether circulating levels of GLP-2 are perturbed in the setting of human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) remains unknown. The circulating levels of bioactive GLP-2-(1-33) compared with its degradation product GLP-2-(3-33) were assessed using a combination of RIA and HPLC in normal and immunocompromised control human subjects and patients hospitalized for IBD. The activity of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV), a key determinant of GLP-2-(1-33) degradation was also assessed in the plasma of normal controls and subjects with IBD. The circulating levels of bioactive GLP-2-(1-33) were increased in patients with either ulcerative colitis (UC) or Crohn's Disease (CD; to 229 +/- 65 and 317 +/- 89%, P < 0.05, of normal, respectively). Furthermore, the proportion of total immunoreactivity represented by intact GLP-2-(1-33), compared with GLP-2-(3-33), was increased from 43 +/- 3% in normal healthy controls to 61 +/- 6% (P < 0.01) and 59 +/- 2% (P < 0.01) in patients with UC and CD, respectively. The relative activity of plasma DP IV was significantly reduced in subjects with IBD compared with normal subjects (1.4 +/- 0.3 vs. 5.0 +/- 1.1 mU/ml, respectively; P < 0.05). These results suggest that patients with active IBD may undergo an adaptive response to intestinal injury by increasing the circulating levels of bioactive GLP-2-(1-33), facilitating enhanced repair of the intestinal mucosal epithelium in vivo.},

   abstract = {The CC-chemokines RANTES, macrophage inflammatory protein 1alpha (MIP-1alpha), and MIP-1beta are natural ligands for the CC-chemokine receptor CCR5. MIP-1alpha, also known as LD78alpha, has an isoform, LD78beta, which was identified as the product of a nonallelic gene. The two isoforms differ in only 3 amino acids. LD78beta was recently reported to be a much more potent CCR5 agonist than LD78alpha and RANTES in inducing intracellular Ca2+ signaling and chemotaxis. CCR5 is expressed by human monocytes/macrophages (M/M) and represents an important coreceptor for macrophage-tropic, CCR5-using (R5) human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) strains to infect the cells. We compared the antiviral activities of LD78beta and the other CC-chemokines in M/M. LD78beta at 100 ng/ml almost completely blocked HIV-1 replication, while at the same concentration LD78alpha had only weak antiviral activity. Moreover, when HIV-1 infection in M/M was monitored by a flow cytometric analysis using p24 antigen intracellular staining, LD78beta proved to be the most antivirally active of the chemokines. RANTES, once described as the most potent chemokine in inhibiting R5 HIV-1 infection, was found to be considerably less active than LD78beta. LD78beta strongly downregulated CCR5 expression in M/M, thereby explaining its potent antiviral activity.},

   abstract = {The purpose of this study was to investigate the feasibility of buccal delivery of a model peptide, endomorphin-1 (ENI), using stability and in vitro permeation studies. ENI is a recently isolated mu-opiate receptor agonist with high selectivity and specificity for this receptor subtype. Stability studies were conducted in various buffers and the drug was shown to be stable in both acidic and basic buffer systems. In the presence of full thickness porcine buccal epithelium, ENI was unstable with only 23.4+/-15.7% intact drug present after 6 h. The region responsible for this degradation was found to coincide with the major barrier region of the buccal epithelium as delineated through stability experiments in the presence of partial thickness buccal epithelium. Various peptidase inhibitors were used to isolate the enzyme(s) responsible for this degradation. Diprotin-A, a potent inhibitor of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, provided significant inhibition of the degradation of ENI in the presence of buccal epithelium. In vitro permeation studies revealed that the permeability coefficient of ENI across porcine buccal epithelium was 5.67+/-4.74x10(-7) cm/s. The enzymatic degradation of ENI was found not to be rate limiting to the drug's permeation across buccal epithelium, as diprotin-A did not increase the permeation of ENI. Sodium glycocholate as well as sodium taurocholate were also ineffective in enhancing the permeation of ENI across porcine buccal epithelium.},

   pages = {637-672},
   abstract = {Histamine-releasing neurons are located exclusively in the TM of the hypothalamus, from where they project to practically all brain regions, with ventral areas (hypothalamus, basal forebrain, amygdala) receiving a particularly strong innervation. The intrinsic electrophysiological properties of TM neurons (slow spontaneous firing, broad action potentials, deep afterhyperpolarisations, etc.) are extremely similar to other aminergic neurons. Their firing rate varies across the sleep-wake cycle, being highest during waking and lowest during rapid-eye movement sleep. In contrast to other aminergic neurons somatodendritic autoreceptors (H3) do not activate an inwardly rectifying potassium channel but instead control firing by inhibiting voltage-dependent calcium channels. Histamine release is enhanced under extreme conditions such as dehydration or hypoglycemia or by a variety of stressors. Histamine activates four types of receptors. H1 receptors are mainly postsynaptically located and are coupled positively to phospholipase C. High densities are found especially in the hypothalamus and other limbic regions. Activation of these receptors causes large depolarisations via blockade of a leak potassium conductance, activation of a non-specific cation channel or activation of a sodium–calcium exchanger. H2 receptors are also mainly postsynaptically located and are coupled positively to adenylyl cyclase. High densities are found in hippocampus, amygdala and basal ganglia. Activation of these receptors also leads to mainly excitatory effects through blockade of calcium-dependent potassium channels and modulation of the hyperpolarisation-activated cation channel. H3 receptors are exclusively presynaptically located and are negatively coupled to adenylyl cyclase. High densities are found in the basal ganglia. These receptors mediated presynaptic inhibition of histamine release and the release of other neurotransmitters, most likely via inhibition of presynaptic calcium channels. Finally, histamine modulates the glutamate NMDA receptor via an action at the polyamine binding site. The central histamine system is involved in many central nervous system functions: arousal; anxiety; activation of the sympathetic nervous system; the stress-related release of hormones from the pituitary and of central aminergic neurotransmitters; antinociception; water retention and suppression of eating. A role for the neuronal histamine system as a danger response system is proposed.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To assess the serum levels, specific activity and other characteristics of dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPP IV/CD26), an ectoenzyme that plays a critical role in the modulation and expression of autoimmune and inflammatory diseases, from patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), primary Sjogren syndrome (SS) and normal controls. To study the possible underlying molecular basis if significant differences were found. METHODS: Serum DPP IV was purified by ion-exchange and affinity chromatography techniques and its specific activity and sera levels were determined by an enzyme-linked assay (ELISA). The enzyme was further analyzed for its sialic acid content, its adenosine deaminase binding capacity and its electrophoretic mobility. The levels of circulating IgA, IgG, and IgM anti-DPP IV autoantibodies were determined by an ELISA technique. RESULTS: The median serum levels of DPP IV in RA patients was similar to controls (0.85 microg/ml versus 1.03 microg/ml, p = n.s.); in SLE and SS patients the enzyme serum levels were reduced to nearly one half of controls (p < 0.001). DPP IV specific activity was significantly reduced in serafrom RA patients when compared with those of SLE, SS and normal sera (12.24 versus 16.5, 19.69 and 16.34 mol pNA x 10(-4)/min/mol respectively, p < 0.005). Both RA and SLE enzymes were hypersialylated, but only RA DPP IV augmented its specific activity to close to control values after desialylation with V. cholerae neuraminidase. Sera from all patient groups contained anti-DPP IV autoantibodies, but only those of the IgA isotype were significantly higher than those found in normal subjects. CONCLUSION: The specific activity of serum DPP IV was decreased only in RA patients, although its levels were similar to normal controls. While both RA and SLE DPP IV were hypersialylated, desialylation restored the specific activity only of RA DPP IV. This finding suggests that different specific glycosylation sites in the enzyme might be involved as the underlying mechanism of the decreased enzyme specific activity of RA patients. The differences in DPP IV levels observed between RA and SLE patients seem to reflect a different status of T cell activation in both diseases.},

   abstract = {In an attempt to identify proteins that assemble with the apical membrane Na+-H+ exchanger isoform NHE3, we generated monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against affinity-purified NHE3 protein complexes isolated from solubilized renal microvillus membrane vesicles. Hybridomas were selected based on their ability to immunoprecipitate NHE3. We have characterized in detail one of the mAbs (1D11) that specifically co-precipitated NHE3 but not villin or NaPi-2. Western blot analyses of microvillus membranes and immunoelectron microscopy of kidney sections showed that mAb 1D11 recognizes a 110-kDa protein highly expressed on the apical membrane of proximal tubule cells. Immunoaffinity chromatography was used to isolate the antigen against which mAb 1D11 is directed. N-terminal sequencing of the purified protein identified it as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) (EC 3.4.14.15), which was confirmed by assays of DPPIV enzyme activity. We also evaluated the distribution of the NHE3-DPPIV complex in microdomains of rabbit renal brush border. In contrast to the previously described NHE3-megalin complex, which principally resides in a dense membrane population (coated pits) in which NHE3 is inactive, the NHE3-DPPIV complex was predominantly in the microvillar fraction in which NHE3 is active. Serial precipitation experiments confirmed that anti-megalin and anti-DPPIV antibodies co-precipitate different pools of NHE3. Taken together, these studies revealed an unexpected association of the brush border Na+-H+ exchanger NHE3 with dipeptidyl peptidase IV in the proximal tubule. These findings raise the possibility that association with DPPIV may affect NHE3 surface expression and/or activity.},

We demonstrate here that the Pg type 2 (Pg 2) receptor in these cells is composed primarily of the membrane glycoprotein dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV). Pg 2 has six glycoforms that differ in their sialic acid content. Only the highly sialylated Pg 2gamma, Pg 2delta and Pg 2epsilon glycoforms bind to DPP IV via their carbohydrate chains and induce a Ca(2+) signalling cascade; however, Pg 2epsilon alone is also able to significantly stimulate expression of MMP-9. We further demonstrate that the Pg-mediated invasive activity of 1-LN cells is dependent on the availability of Pg 2epsilon. This is the first demonstration of a direct association between the expression of MMP-9 and the Pg activation system.},

This dipeptidyl aminopeptidase (DPP IV) activity generally inactivates but sometimes alters or enhances the biological activities of its peptide substrates, which include several chemokines. CD26 costimulates both the CD3 and the CD2 dependent T-cell activation and tyrosine phosphorylation of TCR/CD3 signal transduction pathway proteins. CD26 in vivo has integral membrane protein and soluble forms. Soluble CD26 is at significant levels in serum, these levels alter in many diseases and soluble CD26 can modulate in vitro T-cell proliferation. CD26, being an adenosine deaminase binding protein (ADAbp), functions as a receptor for ADA on lymphocytes. The focus of this review is the structure and function of CD26 and the influence of its ligand binding activity on T-cell proliferation and the T cell costimulatory activity of CD26.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), a serine protease with broad tissue distribution and known activity in serum, has been postulated to modulate nutrition control by modification or inactivation of peptide hormones operating in the enteroinsular axis. We hypothesized that changes of DPP IV activity in serum are related to the nutrition status of patients with eating disorders. Serum DPP IV activity was measured in 52 patients (28 with anorexia nervosa and 24 with bulimia nervosa) in four consecutive weekly analyses. Simultaneously, the number of CD26 (DPP IV)-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes was counted. The same analyses were carried out in 28 healthy female volunteers. In week 1 and throughout the observation period, DPP IV activity in the sera of patients with anorexia nervosa and, to a lesser extent, those with bulimia nervosa was elevated in comparison to that of healthy controls (week 1: means = 92.8 U/L for anorexia-nervosa patients and 89.3 U/L for bulimia-nervosa patients versus 74.7 U/L for healthy control subjects, P = 0.014; weeks 1-4: 91.8 U/L for anorexia-nervosa patients and 86.2 U/L for bulimia-nervosa patients versus 77.6 U/L for healthy controls, P < 0.001). We assume that the increase in DPP IV serum activity will increase the turnover of distinct peptide hormones with known effects on nutrition control and susceptibility to degradation by DPP IV. The potential impact of an increase in DPP IV activity in serum on satiety and nutrition control contributes to previously reported implications for immune function.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV, CD26), a serine protease with broad tissue distribution and known activity in serum, participates in T cell activation and promotes a Th1 cytokine response, a function in part attributable to its enzymatic activity. We hypothesized that the activity of DP IV in serum and expression of CD26/DP IV in lymphocytes may be altered in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). METHODS: Serum DP IV activity and CD26 (DP IV)-positive peripheral blood lymphocytes were measured in 110 patients with IBD (Crohn disease (CD): n = 63, ulcerative colitis (UC): n = 47). Additionally, T cell activation antigens (CD25, CD95) and costimulatory molecules (CD28) were evaluated. The same analyses were carried out in healthy volunteers (HC, n = 28). Thirty-nine patients with CD and 28 patients with UC were reassessed 3-6 months after the first visit. RESULTS: In patients with IBD, the DP IV activity in serum was reduced (mean +/- s (standard deviation): 52.8 U/l +/- 16.9 (CD) and 55.7 +/- 15.1 U/l (UC) versus 71.9 +/- 18.4 (HC), P < 0.001). Furthermore, patients with IBD had higher numbers of CD26-positive cells coexpressing CD25 and a higher surface expression of CD26 (DP IV) (mean fluorescence intensity, mean 57.1 (CD) and 59.8 (UC) versus 29.9 (HC), P < 0.001). The DP IV activity in serum showed an inverse correlation with known disease activity scores as well as with the concentrations of orosomucoid in serum. CONCLUSION: The changes of DP IV in patients with IBD highlight alterations at an interface between immune function and metabolism of peptide hormones, with potential importance for the pathophysiology of IBD. Furthermore, these changes may help to refine the assessment of IBD activity.},

   abstract = {MOTIVATION: Subcellular localization is a key functional characteristic of proteins. A fully automatic and reliable prediction system for protein subcellular localization is needed, especially for the analysis of large-scale genome sequences. RESULTS: In this paper, Support Vector Machine has been introduced to predict the subcellular localization of proteins from their amino acid compositions. The total prediction accuracies reach 91.4% for three subcellular locations in prokaryotic organisms and 79.4% for four locations in eukaryotic organisms. Predictions by our approach are robust to errors in the protein N-terminal sequences. This new approach provides superior prediction performance compared with existing algorithms based on amino acid composition and can be a complementary method to other existing methods based on sorting signals. AVAILABILITY: A web server implementing the prediction method is available at http://www.bioinfo.tsinghua.edu.cn/SubLoc/.

   abstract = {Many peptide hormones elicit a wide array of physiological effects by binding to G-protein coupled receptors. We have determined the conformation of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide, PACAP(1--21)NH(2), bound to a PACAP-specific receptor by NMR spectroscopy. Residues 3--7 form a unique beta-coil structure that is preceded by an N-terminal extended tail. This beta-coil creates a patch of hydrophobic residues that is important for receptor binding. In contrast, the C-terminal region (residues 8--21) forms an alpha-helix, similar to that in the micelle-bound PACAP. Thus, the conformational difference between PACAP in the receptor-bound and the micelle-bound states is limited to the N-terminal seven residues. This observation is consistent with the two-step ligand transportation model in which PACAP first binds to the membrane nonspecifically and then diffuses two-dimensionally in search of its receptor; a conformational change at the N-terminal region then allows specific interactions between the ligand and the receptor.},

DPPIV/CD26 sequentially cleaves off two dipeptides of VIP, PACAP27, PACAP38 and GRP. GRP situates between the best DPPIV/CD26 substrates reported, comparable to NPY. Surprisingly, the C-terminal extension of PACAP38, distant from the scissile bond, improves both PACAP38 binding and turnover. Therefore, residues remote from the scissile bond can modulate DPPIV/CD26 substrate selectivity as well as residues flanking it.},

   abstract = {Chemokines coordinate many aspects of leukocyte migration. As chemoattractants they play an important role in the innate and acquired immune response. There is good experimental evidence that N-terminal truncation by secreted or cell surface proteases is a way of modulating chemokine action. The localization of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV on cell surfaces and in biological fluids, its primary specificity, and the type of naturally occurring truncated chemokines are consistent with such a function. We determined the steady-state catalytic parameters for a relevant selection of chemokines (CCL3b, CCL5, CCL11, CCL22, CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL12) previously reported to alter their chemotactic behavior due to CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV-catalyzed truncation. The results reveal a striking selectivity for stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (CXCL12) and macrophage-derived chemokine (CCL22). The kinetic parameters support the hypothesis that CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV contributes to the degradation of certain chemokines in vivo. The data not only provide insight into the selectivity of the enzyme for specific chemokines, but they also contribute to the general understanding of CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV secondary substrate specificity.},

   abstract = {Fourier-transform ion cyclotron resonance instrumentation is uniquely applicable to an unusual new ion chemistry, electron capture dissociation (ECD). This causes nonergodic dissociation of far larger molecules (42 kDa) than previously observed (<1 kDa), with the resulting unimolecular ion chemistry also unique because it involves radical site reactions for similarly larger ions. ECD is highly complementary to the well known energetic methods for multiply charged ion dissociation, providing much more extensive protein sequence information, including the direct identification of N- versus C-terminal fragment ions. Because ECD only excites the molecule near the cleavage site, accompanying rearrangements are minimized. Counterintuitively, cleavage of backbone covalent bonds of protein ions is favored over that of noncovalent bonds; larger (>10 kDa) ions give far more extensive ECD if they are first thermally activated. This high specificity for covalent bond cleavage also makes ECD promising for studying the secondary and tertiary structure of gaseous protein ions caused by noncovalent bonding.},

Oral glucose tolerance test indicated improved glucose tolerance in F344/DuCrj rats, but blood glucose levels of the two strains were almost the same 120 min after the glucose bolus. Valine-pyrrolidide, a DPPIV inhibitor, had no effect on the glucose tolerance of F344/DuCrj rats, but improved that of F344/Jcl rats. Enhanced insulin secretion and high plasma active GLP-1 levels were detected in an intraduodenal glucose tolerance test. Glucose tolerance is improved in DPPIV-deficient F344/DuCrj rats via enhanced insulin release mediated by high active GLP-1 levels. Our results suggest that DPPIV inhibition is a rational strategy to treat diabetic patients by improving glucose tolerance with low risk of hypoglycemia.},

   abstract = {Human Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP), a member of the serine prolyl oligopeptidase family, is a type II cell surface glycoprotein that acts as a dual-specificity dipeptidyl-peptidase (DPP) and collagenase in vitro. Its restricted expression pattern in embryonic mesenchyme, in wound healing and in reactive stromal fibroblasts of epithelial cancers, has suggested a role for the FAP protease in extracellular matrix degradation or growth factor activation in sites of tissue remodeling. The FAP homologue in Xenopus laevis has been reported to be induced in the thyroid hormone-induced tail resorption program during tadpole metamorphosis supporting a role for FAP in tissue remodeling processes during embryonic development. However, Fap-deficient mice show no overt developmental defects and are viable. To study the expression of FAP during mouse embryogenesis, a second Fap-deficient mouse strain expressing beta-Galactosidase under the control of the Fap promoter was generated by homologous recombination (Fap-/- lacZ mice). FAP deficiency was confirmed by the absence of FAP-specific dipeptidyl-peptidase activity in detergent-soluble extracts isolated from 17.5 d.p.c. Fap-/- lacZ embryos. We report that Fap-/- lacZ mice express beta-Galactosidase at regions of active tissue remodeling during embryogenesis including somites and perichondrial mesenchyme from cartilage primordia.},

   abstract = {We review the evidence suggesting that hypothalamic growth hormone (GH)-releasing hormone (GHRH) stimulates sleep and growth hormone secretion simultaneously. GHRH injected into the cerebral ventricles, systemic circulation or the preoptic region enhances non-REM sleep (NREMS) in rats, rabbits and mice, and GHRH administered systemically promotes NREMS in humans. GHRH may also stimulate REMS but this effect is indirect and requires the presence of GH. Inhibition of endogenous GHRH (antibodies, antagonist, somatostatin, high doses of GH or IGF-1) suppresses both NREMS and GH secretion. Mutant rats and mice with deficiencies of GHRH signaling, and transgenic mice with decreased GHRH production sleep less than normal animals. Hypothalamic GHRH mRNA and GHRH content display diurnal variations and change in response to sleep deprivation. The NREMS-promoting activity of GHRH is independent of GH and is mediated by the preoptic region. It is suggested that promotion of NREMS and stimulation of GH are parallel outputs of hypothalamic GHRH through which anabolic activities in the body are are synchronized to periods of sleep.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a T cell costimulatory molecule with dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme activity in its extracellular region. We have previously reported that the addition of soluble CD26 (sCD26) resulted in enhanced proliferation of peripheral blood T lymphocytes induced by the recall Ag, tetanus toxoid (TT). However, the mechanism involved in this immune enhancement has not yet been elucidated. In this paper, we demonstrate that the enhancing effect of sCD26 on TT-induced T cell proliferation occurred in the early stages of immune response. The cells directly affected by exogenously added sCD26 are the CD14-positive monocytes in the peripheral blood. Mannose-6 phosphate interfered with the uptake of sCD26 into monocytes, suggesting that mannose-6 phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor plays a role in the transportation of sCD26 into monocytes. When sCD26 was added after Ag presentation had taken place, enhancement in TT-induced T cell proliferation was not observed. In addition, enhancement of TT-mediated T cell proliferation by sCD26 does not result from trimming of the MHC-bound peptide on the surface of monocytes. Importantly, we also showed that exogenously added sCD26 up-regulated the expression of the costimulatory molecule CD86 on monocytes through its dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity, and that this increased expression of CD86 was observed at both protein and mRNA level. Therefore, our findings suggest that sCD26 enhances T cell immune response to recall Ag via its direct effect on APCs.},

   abstract = {Glucagon is a 29-amino acid polypeptide released from pancreatic islet alpha-cells that acts to maintain euglycemia by stimulating hepatic glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis. Despite its importance, there remains controversy about the mechanisms responsible for glucagon clearance in the body. In the current study, enzymatic metabolism of glucagon was assessed using sensitive mass spectrometric techniques to identify the molecular products. Incubation of glucagon with purified porcine dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) yielded sequential production of glucagon(3-29) and glucagon(5-29). In human serum, degradation to glucagon(3-29) was rapidly followed by N-terminal cyclization of glucagon, preventing further DP IV-mediated hydrolysis. Bioassay of glucagon, following incubation with purified DP IV or normal rat serum demonstrated a significant loss of hyperglycemic activity, while a similar incubation in DP IV-deficient rat serum did not show any loss of glucagon bioactivity. Degradation, monitored by mass spectrometry and bioassay, was blocked by the specific DP IV inhibitor, isoleucyl thiazolidine. These results identify DP IV as a primary enzyme involved in the degradation and inactivation of glucagon. These findings have important implications for the determination of glucagon levels in human plasma.},

   journal = {Leukemia Research},
   volume = {25},
   number = {7},
   pages = {603-625},
   abstract = {The term ‘mastocytosis’ denotes a heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by abnormal growth and accumulation of mast cells (MC) in one or more organ systems. Over the last 20 years, there has been an evolution in accepted classification systems for this disease. In light of such developments and novel useful markers, it seems appropriate now to re-evaluate and update the classification of mastocytosis. Here, we propose criteria to delineate categories of mastocytosis together with an updated consensus classification system. In this proposal, the diagnosis cutaneous mastocytosis (CM) is based on typical clinical and histological skin lesions and absence of definitive signs (criteria) of systemic involvement. Most patients with CM are children and present with maculopapular cutaneous mastocytosis (=urticaria pigmentosa, UP). Other less frequent forms of CM are diffuse cutaneous mastocytosis (DCM) and mastocytoma of skin. Systemic mastocytosis (SM) is commonly seen in adults and defined by multifocal histological lesions in the bone marrow (affected almost invariably) or other extracutaneous organs (major criteria) together with cytological and biochemical signs (minor criteria) of systemic disease (SM-criteria). SM is further divided into the following categories: indolent systemic mastocytosis (ISM), SM with an a̱ssociated clonal ẖematologic ṉon-m̱ast cell lineage ḏisease (AHNMD), aggressive systemic mastocytosis (ASM), and mast cell leukemia (MCL). Patients with ISM usually have maculopapular skin lesions and a good prognosis. In the group with associated hematologic disease, the AHNMD should be classified according to FAB/WHO criteria. ASM is characterized by impaired organ-function due to infiltration of the bone marrow, liver, spleen, GI-tract, or skeletal system, by pathologic MC. MCL is a ‘high-grade’ leukemic disease defined by increased numbers of MC in bone marrow smears (≥20%) and peripheral blood, absence of skin lesions, multiorgan failure, and a short survival. In typical cases, circulating MC amount to ≥10% of leukocytes (classical form of MCL). Mast cell sarcoma is a unifocal tumor that consists of atypical MC and shows a destructive growth without (primary) systemic involvement. This high-grade malignant MC disease has to be distinguished from a localized benign mastocytoma in either extracutaneous organs (=extracutaneous mastocytoma) or skin. Depending on the clinical course of mastocytosis and development of an AHNMD, patients can shift from one category of MC disease into another. In all categories, mediator-related symptoms may occur and may represent a serious clinical problem. All categories of mastocytosis should be distinctively separated from reactive MC hyperplasia, MC activation syndromes, and a more or less pronounced increase in MC in myelogenous malignancies other than mastocytosis. Criteria proposed in this article should be helpful in this regard.},

   abstract = {A 2.91-billion base pair (bp) consensus sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome was generated by the whole-genome shotgun sequencing method. The 14.8-billion bp DNA sequence was generated over 9 months from 27,271,853 high-quality sequence reads (5.11-fold coverage of the genome) from both ends of plasmid clones made from the DNA of five individuals. Two assembly strategies-a whole-genome assembly and a regional chromosome assembly-were used, each combining sequence data from Celera and the publicly funded genome effort. The public data were shredded into 550-bp segments to create a 2.9-fold coverage of those genome regions that had been sequenced, without including biases inherent in the cloning and assembly procedure used by the publicly funded group. This brought the effective coverage in the assemblies to eightfold, reducing the number and size of gaps in the final assembly over what would be obtained with 5.11-fold coverage. The two assembly strategies yielded very similar results that largely agree with independent mapping data. The assemblies effectively cover the euchromatic regions of the human chromosomes. More than 90% of the genome is in scaffold assemblies of 100,000 bp or more, and 25% of the genome is in scaffolds of 10 million bp or larger. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed 26,588 protein-encoding transcripts for which there was strong corroborating evidence and an additional approximately 12,000 computationally derived genes with mouse matches or other weak supporting evidence. Although gene-dense clusters are obvious, almost half the genes are dispersed in low G+C sequence separated by large tracts of apparently noncoding sequence. Only 1.1% of the genome is spanned by exons, whereas 24% is in introns, with 75% of the genome being intergenic DNA. Duplications of segmental blocks, ranging in size up to chromosomal lengths, are abundant throughout the genome and reveal a complex evolutionary history. Comparative genomic analysis indicates vertebrate expansions of genes associated with neuronal function, with tissue-specific developmental regulation, and with the hemostasis and immune systems. DNA sequence comparisons between the consensus sequence and publicly funded genome data provided locations of 2.1 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). A random pair of human haploid genomes differed at a rate of 1 bp per 1250 on average, but there was marked heterogeneity in the level of polymorphism across the genome. Less than 1% of all SNPs resulted in variation in proteins, but the task of determining which SNPs have functional consequences remains an open challenge.},

   abstract = {Macrophage-derived chemokine (MDC)/CCL22 is a CC chemokine active on dendritic cells (DC), NK cells and Th2 lymphocytes. The present study was aimed at comprehensively investigating MDC production in vitro and in vivo. DC were the most potent producers of MDC among leukocytes tested. Endothelial cells did not produce MDC under a variety of conditions. Signals that induce maturation (lipopolysaccharide, IL-1, TNF, CD40 ligand, recognition of bacteria and yeast) dramatically augmented MDC production, and dexamethasone and vitamin D3 blocked it. Prostaglandin E2, which blocked the acquisition of IL-12 production and the capacity to promote Th1 generation, did not affect MDC production. Using mass spectrometry-based techniques, DC supernatants were found to contain N-terminally truncated forms of MDC [MDC(3–69), MDC(5–69) and MD(C7–69)] as well as the full-length molecule. In vivo, CD1a+, CD83+, MDC+ DC were found in reactive lymph nodes, and in Langerhans' cell histiocytosis. Skin lesions of atopic dermatitis patients showed that CD1a+ or CD1b+ DC, and DC with a CD83+ phenotype were responsible for MDC production in this Th2-oriented disorder. Thus, DC are the predominant source of MDC in vitro and in vivo under a variety of experimental and clinical conditions. Processing of MDC to MDC(3–69) and shorter forms which do not recognize CCR4 is likely to represent a feedback mechanism of negative regulation.},

   abstract = {Drug resistance has sharply limited the effectiveness of HIV-1 protease inhibitors in AIDS therapy. It is critically important to understand the basis of this resistance for designing new drugs. We have evaluated the free energy contribution of each residue in the HIV protease in binding to one of its substrates and to the five FDA-approved protease drugs. Analysis of these free energy profiles and the variability at each sequence position suggests: (i) single drug resistance mutations are likely to occur at not well conserved residues if they interact more favorably with drugs than with the substrate; and (ii) resistance-evading drugs should have a free energy profile similar to the substrate and interact most favorably with well conserved residues. We also propose an empirical parameter, called the free energy/variability value, which combines free energy calculation and sequence analysis to suggest possible drug resistance mutations on the protease. The free energy/variability value is defined as the product of one residue's contribution to the binding free energy and the variability of that residue. This parameter can assist in designing resistance-evading drugs for any target.},

   abstract = {Previous studies have shown that several proteolytic enzymes are associated with membrane protrusions at the leading edge of migrating tumor cells. In this study we demonstrate that seprase and the urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (uPAR), co-localize in the plasma membrane of LOX malignant melanoma cells. Cells were labeled with fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (mAb) directed against seprase and uPAR. Proximity between these two molecules was detected with resonance energy transfer (RET) imaging, single-cell emission spectrophotometry, and single-cell excitation spectrophotometry. Significant RET signals were detected on LOX cells when adherent to uncoated and extracellular matrix (ECM)-coated surfaces. This indicates that seprase and uPAR are within approximately 7 nm in the plasma membrane of LOX cells. When LOX cells adhered to a 3D extracellular-like matrix, seprase-uPAR complexes were found to be associated with invadopodia. Further microscopy experiments demonstrated gelatinolytic activity, a functional attribute of seprase, in association with seprase-uPAR membrane domains. Formation of seprase-uPAR membrane complexes is dependent upon both the cytoskeleton and integrins. Specifically, the involvement of beta(1)-integrins was demonstrated by the inhibition of RET by an inhibitory anti-beta(1)-integrin mAb. Based on these findings, we speculate that formation of heterogeneous lytic domains in the invading membranes of LOX cells increases the efficiency of directed pericellular proteolysis.},

CXCR3 binding chemokines are unique in their ability to bind receptors from both the CC and CXC classes of chemokine receptors. An unusual structural feature of IP-10 was identified that may provide the basis for the ability of IP-10 to bind both CXCR3 and CCR3. The surface of IP-10 that interacts with the N-terminus of CXCR3 was defined by monitoring changes in the NMR spectrum of IP-10 upon addition of a CXCR3 N-terminal peptide. These studies indicated that the interaction involves a hydrophobic cleft, formed by the N-loop and 40s-loop region of IP-10, similar to the interaction surface observed for other chemokines such as IL-8. An additional region of interaction was observed that consists of a hydrophobic cleft formed by the N-terminus of IP-10 and 30s-loop of IP-10.},

In particular, we discuss findings demonstrating that CD26/DPPIV has an essential role in immune regulation as a T cell activation molecule and a regulator of chemokine function. We also review recent studies that identify key cellular molecules that physically associate with CD26 and the potential consequences of their interaction, including those with clinically-related implications. Furthermore, we present work suggesting a role for CD26 in the pathogenesis and behavior of selected human cancers, both solid tumors and hematological malignancies. We present recent studies that investigate the potential role of CD26 as a molecular target for novel treatment modalities for T cell lymphoid malignancies and possibly other hematological malignancies, with work involving the use of anti-CD26 monoclonal antibody, CD26-transfected cells as well as soluble CD26 molecules.},

   abstract = {The incretin hormones glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) are degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), thereby losing insulinotropic activity. DPP IV inhibition reduces exogenous GLP-1 degradation, but the extent of endogenous incretin protection has not been fully assessed, largely because suitable assays which distinguish between intact and degraded peptides have been unavailable. Using newly developed assays for intact GLP-1 and GIP, the effect of DPP IV inhibition on incretin hormone metabolism was examined. Conscious dogs were given NVP-DPP728, a specific DPP IV inhibitor, at a dose that inhibited over 90% of plasma DPP IV for the first 90 min following treatment. Total and intact incretin concentrations increased (P<0.0001) following a mixed meal, but on control days (vehicle infusion), intact peptide concentrations were lower (P<0.01) than total peptide concentrations (22.6 +/- 1.2% intact GIP; 10.1 +/- 0.4% intact GLP-1). Following inhibitor treatment, the proportion of intact peptide increased (92.5 +/- 4.3% intact GIP, P<0.0001; 99.0 +/- 22.6% intact GLP-1, P<0.02). Active (intact) incretins increased after NVP-DPP728 (from 4797 +/- 364 to 10 649 +/- 106 pM x min for GIP, P<0.03; from 646 +/- 134 to 2822 +/- 528 pM x m in for GLP-1, P<0.05). In contrast, total incretins fell (from 21 632 +/- 654 to 12 084 +/- 1723 pM x min for GIP, P<0.002; from 5145 +/- 677 to 3060 +/- 601 pM x min for GLP-1, P<0.05). Plasma glucose, insulin and glucagon concentrations were unaltered by the inhibitor. We have concluded that DPP IV inhibition with NVP-DPP728 prevents N-terminal degradation of endogenous incretins in vivo, resulting in increased plasma concentrations of intact, biologically active GIP and GLP-1. Total incretin secretion was reduced by DPP IV inhibition, suggesting the possibility of a feedback mechanism.},

   abstract = {Chemokines are the largest family of cytokines in human immunophysiology. These proteins are defined by four invariant cysteines and are categorized based on the sequence around the first two cysteines, which leads to two major and two minor subfamilies. Chemokines function by activating specific G protein-coupled receptors, which results in, among other functions, the migration of inflammatory and noninflammatory cells to the appropriate tissues or compartments within tissues. Some of these proteins and receptors have been implicated or shown to be involved in inflammation, autoimmune diseases, and infection by HIV-1. The three-dimensional structure of each monomer is virtually identical, but the quaternary structure of chemokines is different for each subfamily. Structure-function studies reveal several regions of chemokines to be involved in function, with the N-terminal region playing a dominant role. A number of proteins and small-molecule antagonists have been identified that inhibit chemokine activities. In this review, we discuss aspects of the structure, function, and inhibition of chemokines.},

The present study examined the biological activity of this abundant circulating fragment peptide to establish its possible role in GIP action. Human GIP and GIP(3-42) were synthesised by Fmoc solid-phase peptide synthesis, purified by HPLC and characterised by electrospray ionisation-mass spectrometry. In GIP receptor-transfected Chinese hamster lung fibroblasts, GIP(3-42) dose dependently inhibited GIP-stimulated (10(-7) M) cAMP production (up to 75.4+/-5.4%; P<0.001). In BRIN-BD11 cells, GIP(3-42) was significantly less potent at stimulating insulin secretion (1.9- to 3.2-fold; P<0.001), compared with native GIP and significantly inhibited GIP-stimulated (10(-7) M) insulin secretion with maximal inhibition (48.8+/-6.2%; P<0.001) observed at 10(-7) M. In (ob/ob) mice, administration of GIP(3-42) significantly inhibited GIP-stimulated insulin release (2.1-fold decrease; P<0.001) and exaggerated the glycaemic excursion (1.4-fold; P<0.001) induced by a conjoint glucose load. These data indicate that the N-terminally truncated GIP(3-42) fragment acts as a GIP receptor antagonist, moderating the insulin secreting and metabolic actions of GIP in vivo.},

   abstract = {The invasion of migratory cells through connective tissues involves metallo- and serine types of cell surface proteases. We show that formation of a novel protease complex, consisting of the membrane-bound prolyl peptidases seprase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), at invadopodia of migratory fibroblasts is a prerequisite for cell invasion and migration on a collagenous matrix. Seprase and DPPIV form a complex on the cell surface that elicits both gelatin binding and gelatinase activities localized at invadopodia of cells migrating on collagenous fibers. The protease complex participates in the binding to gelatin and localized gelatin degradation, cellular migration, and monolayer wound closure. Serine protease inhibitors can block the gelatinase activity and the localized gelatin degradation by cells. Antibodies to the gelatin-binding domain of DPPIV reduce the cellular abilities of the proteases to degrade gelatin but do not affect cellular adhesion or spreading on type I collagen. Furthermore, expression of the seprase-DPPIV complex is restricted to migratory cells involved in wound closure in vitro and in connective tissue cells during closure of gingival wounds but not in differentiated tissue cells. Thus, we have identified cell surface proteolytic activities, which are non-metalloproteases, seprase and DPPIV, that are responsible for the tissue-invasive phenotype.},

   abstract = {In this study, we have found that dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) plays in vivo an active role in the modulation of the inflammatory response of chronic rhinosinusitis. Human nasal mucosa expresses DPPIV-like immunoreactivity in submucosal seromucus glands, leukocytes, and endothelial cells of blood vessels. DPPIV enzymatic activity in nasal tissue biopsies taken from patients suffering from chronic rhinosinusitis was correlated inversely with the density of inflammatory cells in the nasal mucosa, and the DPPIV activity rose when chronic rhinosinusitis was treated. By using a pig animal model, we have shown that the intranasal administration of recombinant DPPIV decreased the vasodilatation induced by exogenous substance P (SP), a proinflammatory peptide released by sensory nerves. In contrast, an inhibitor of DPPIV enhanced the vasodilatatory effect at low doses of SP. SP5-11 was 100- to 1000-fold less potent than SP as a vasodilator of the nasal mucosa. The vasodilatatory effect of SP was abolished by a NK1 receptor antagonist. In conclusion, these results suggest a new pathophysiological pathway for rhinitis based on clinical observations in humans, indicating the involvement of an enzyme to modulate non-adrenergic and non-cholinergic substrate that occurred during nasal dysfunctions.},

   abstract = {Anopheles gambiae is the principal vector of malaria, a disease that afflicts more than 500 million people and causes more than 1 million deaths each year. Tenfold shotgun sequence coverage was obtained from the PEST strain of A. gambiae and assembled into scaffolds that span 278 million base pairs. A total of 91% of the genome was organized in 303 scaffolds; the largest scaffold was 23.1 million base pairs. There was substantial genetic variation within this strain, and the apparent existence of two haplotypes of approximately equal frequency (“dual haplotypes”) in a substantial fraction of the genome likely reflects the outbred nature of the PEST strain. The sequence produced a conservative inference of more than 400,000 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that showed a markedly bimodal density distribution. Analysis of the genome sequence revealed strong evidence for about 14,000 protein-encoding transcripts. Prominent expansions in specific families of proteins likely involved in cell adhesion and immunity were noted. An expressed sequence tag analysis of genes regulated by blood feeding provided insights into the physiological adaptations of a hematophagous insect.},

In addition to its membrane form, CD26 exists in plasma as a soluble form (sCD26), which is the extracellular domain of the molecule thought to be cleaved from the cell surface. In this paper, we demonstrate that sCD26 mediates enhanced transendothelial T cell migration, an effect that requires its intrinsic DPPIV enzyme activity. We also show that sCD26 directly targets endothelial cells and that mannose 6-phosphate/insulin-like growth factor II receptor (M6P/IGFIIR) on the endothelial cell surface acts as a receptor for sCD26. Our findings therefore suggest that sCD26 influences T cell migration through its interaction with M6P/IGFIIR.},

   abstract = {As we emerge into the post-genome era, proteomics finds itself as the driving force field as we translate the nucleic acid information archive into understanding how the cell actually works and how disease processes operate. Even so, the traditionally held view of proteomics as simply cataloging and developing lists of the cellular protein repertoire of a cell are now changing, especially in the sub-discipline of clinical proteomics. The most relevant information archive to clinical applications and drug development involves the elucidation of the information flow of the cell; the "software" of protein pathway networks and circuitry. The deranged circuitry of the cell as the drug target itself as well as the effect of the drug on not just the target, but also the entire network, is what we now are striving towards. Clinical proteomics, as a new and most exciting sub-discipline of proteomics, involves the bench-to-bedside clinical application of proteomic tools. Unlike the genome, there are potentially thousands of proteomes: each cell type has its own unique proteome. Moreover, each cell type can alter its proteome depending on the unique tissue microenvironment in which it resides, giving rise to multiple permutations of a single proteome. Since there is no polymerase chain reaction equivalent to proteomics- identifying and discovering the "wiring diagram" of a human diseased cell in a biopsy specimen remains a daunting challenge. New micro-proteomic technologies are being and still need to be developed to drill down into the proteomes of clinically relevant material. Cancer, as a model disease, provides a fertile environment to study the application of proteomics at the bedside. The promise of clinical proteomics and the new technologies that are developed is that we will detect cancer earlier through discovery of biomarkers, we will discover the next generation of targets and imaging biomarkers, and we can then apply this knowledge to patient-tailored therapy.},

Previous studies suggested that the in vivo metabolism of GLP-1 is much faster than that of GLP-2. In this paper, we investigated the in vitro truncation of GLP-2 and GLP-1 by DPP IV. The slower conversion rate observed for GLP-2 compared to GLP-1 was due to an approximately 10-fold reduction in catalytic rate constant.

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Activated hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), recognised by their alpha smooth muscle actin immunoreactivity, are primarily responsible for liver fibrosis. However, the presence of alpha smooth muscle actin positive HSCs is not always associated with the development of liver fibrosis. Recently, other markers of human HSCs including the gelatinase fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and glial fibrillary acidic protein have been identified. AIMS: We examined the relationship between the expression of these HSC markers and the severity of liver injury in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection. METHODS: Liver tissue from 27 patients was examined using immunohistochemistry. Linear correlation analysis was used to compare staining scores with the stage and grade of liver injury. RESULTS-CONCLUSIONS: FAP expression, seen at the tissue-remodelling interface, was strongly and significantly correlated with the severity of liver fibrosis. A weaker correlation was seen between glial fibrillary acidic protein expression and fibrosis stage. This contrasted with the absence of a relationship between alpha smooth muscle actin and the fibrotic score. A correlation was also observed between FAP expression and necroinflammatory score. In summary, FAP expression identifies a HSC subpopulation at the tissue-remodelling interface that is related to the severity of liver fibrosis.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV/CD26) is a costimulatory molecule as well as a protease highly expressed on T cells. Purified DPP IV has been recognized to inactivate peptide hormones, neuropeptides, and some chemokines by cleavage behind a proline residue at the penultimate N-terminal amino acid position. Here, we identified another substrate for DPP IV among the chemokine family: the interferon-inducible T cell alpha chemoattractant (I-TAC/CXCL11). Using a specific DPP IV inhibitor, we demonstrate that DPP IV is responsible for the cleavage of the chemokine by PHA/IL-2-treated T cells. As PHA/IL-2-treated T cells also express the CXCL11 receptor (CXCR3), we investigated whether truncation of CXCL11 would modulate its biological activity for these cells. Truncated CXCL11 [CXCL11(3-73)] had an eightfold reduced potential to bind and to regulate CXCR3, but was completely inactive in calcium flux and chemotaxis assays. However, consistent with its reduced but still considerable ability to down-regulate CXCR3, truncated CXCL11 desensitized T cell chemotaxis in response to the intact chemokine. Hence, CXCL11-induced T cell recruitment may be regulated by DPP IV-mediated proteolytic inactivation of CXCL11 and furthermore by desensitization of T cells via the degradation product CXCL11(3-73).},

   abstract = {Monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-3 is inactivated upon cleavage by the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) gelatinase A (MMP-2). We investigated the susceptibility to proteolytic processing of the 4 human MCPs by 8 recombinant MMPs to determine whether MCP-3 is an isolated example or represents a general susceptibility of chemokines to proteolytic inactivation by these important inflammatory proteases. In addition to MMP-2, MCP-3 is efficiently cleaved by membrane type 1 (MT1)-MMP, the cellular activator of MMP-2, and by collagenase-1 and collagenase-3 (MMP-1, MMP-13) and stromelysin-1 (MMP-3). Specificity was shown by absence of cleavage by matrilysin (MMP-7) and the leukocytic MMPs neutrophil collagenase (MMP-8) and gelatinase B (MMP-9). The closely related chemokines MCP-1, MCP-2, and MCP-4 were not cleaved by MMP-2 or MT1-MMP, but were cleaved by MMP-1 and MMP-3 with varying efficiency. MCPs were typically cleaved between residues 4 and 5, but MCP-4 was further processed at Val7-Pro8. Synthetic MCP analogs corresponding to the MMP-cleaved forms bound CC chemokine receptor (CCR)-2 and CCR-3, but lacked chemoattractant activity in pre-B cells transfected with CCR-2 and CCR-3 or in THP-1 monocytic cells, a transformed leukemic cell line. Moreover, the truncated products of MCP-2 and MCP-4, like MCP-3, were potent antagonists of their cognate CC chemokine receptors in transwell cell migration assays in vitro. When they were injected 24 hours after the initiation of carrageenan-induced inflammation in rat paws, their in vivo antagonist activities were revealed by a greater than 66% reduction in inflammatory edema progression after 12 hours. We propose that MMPs have an important role in modulating inflammatory and immune responses by processing chemokines in wound healing and in disease.},

   abstract = {Metformin is an effective hypoglycemic drug that lowers blood glucose concentrations by decreasing hepatic glucose production and increasing glucose disposal in skeletal muscle; however, the molecular site of metformin action is not well understood. AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) activity increases in response to depletion of cellular energy stores, and this enzyme has been implicated in the stimulation of glucose uptake into skeletal muscle and the inhibition of liver gluconeogenesis. We recently reported that AMPK is activated by metformin in cultured rat hepatocytes, mediating the inhibitory effects of the drug on hepatic glucose production. In the present study, we evaluated whether therapeutic doses of metformin increase AMPK activity in vivo in subjects with type 2 diabetes. Metformin treatment for 10 weeks significantly increased AMPK alpha2 activity in the skeletal muscle, and this was associated with increased phosphorylation of AMPK on Thr172 and decreased acetyl-CoA carboxylase-2 activity. The increase in AMPK alpha2 activity was likely due to a change in muscle energy status because ATP and phosphocreatine concentrations were lower after metformin treatment. Metformin-induced increases in AMPK activity were associated with higher rates of glucose disposal and muscle glycogen concentrations. These findings suggest that the metabolic effects of metformin in subjects with type 2 diabetes may be mediated by the activation of AMPK alpha2.},

DPP IV (EC 3.4.14.5) is a serine protease with a rare enzyme activity having an important role in the regulation of various processes, such as blood glucose control and immune responses. Here, we report the identification and characterization of a novel DPP IV-like molecule, termed dipeptidyl peptidase-like protein 9 (DPP9). The deduced amino acid sequence of DPP9 has a serine protease motif, GWSYG, identical to that found in DPP IV. The presence of this motif, together with a conserved order and spacing of the Ser, Asp, and His residues that form the catalytic triad in DPP IV, places DPP9 in the "DPP IV gene family". Northern blots showed that DPP9 is ubiquitously expressed, with the highest expression levels in skeletal muscle, heart, and liver, and the lowest in brain. In vitro translation of the cloned full-length DPP9 sequence resulted in a DPP9 protein product that migrated in sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis at a position similar to the predicted protein size of 98 kDa. Consistent with the lack of predicted transmembrane domains and a signal sequence, DPP9 was found in a soluble, putative cytosolic form. A DPP9 orthologue in mice was identified by expressed sequence tag database searches and verified by cDNA cloning.},

   abstract = {Quantitative proteomics has traditionally been performed by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, but recently, mass spectrometric methods based on stable isotope quantitation have shown great promise for the simultaneous and automated identification and quantitation of complex protein mixtures. Here we describe a method, termed SILAC, for stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture, for the in vivo incorporation of specific amino acids into all mammalian proteins. Mammalian cell lines are grown in media lacking a standard essential amino acid but supplemented with a non-radioactive, isotopically labeled form of that amino acid, in this case deuterated leucine (Leu-d3). We find that growth of cells maintained in these media is no different from growth in normal media as evidenced by cell morphology, doubling time, and ability to differentiate. Complete incorporation of Leu-d3 occurred after five doublings in the cell lines and proteins studied. Protein populations from experimental and control samples are mixed directly after harvesting, and mass spectrometric identification is straightforward as every leucine-containing peptide incorporates either all normal leucine or all Leu-d3. We have applied this technique to the relative quantitation of changes in protein expression during the process of muscle cell differentiation. Proteins that were found to be up-regulated during this process include glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, fibronectin, and pyruvate kinase M2. SILAC is a simple, inexpensive, and accurate procedure that can be used as a quantitative proteomic approach in any cell culture system.},

   abstract = {The hypothesis that chromogranin A (CgA), a protein of neuroendocrine cell secretory granules, may be a precursor of biologically active peptides, rests on observed activities of peptide fragments largely produced by exogenous protease digestion of the bovine protein. Here we have adopted a modified proteomic strategy to isolate and characterise human CgA-derived peptides produced by endogenous prohormone convertases. Initial focus was on an insulinoma as previous studies have shown that CgA is rapidly processed in pancreatic beta cells and that tumours arising from these express appropriate prohormone convertases. Eleven novel peptides were identified arising from processing at both monobasic and dibasic sites and processing was most evident in the C-terminal domain of the protein. Some of these peptides were identified in endocrine tumours, such as mid-gut carcinoid and phaeochromocytoma, which arise from endocrine cells of different phenotype and in different anatomical sites. Two of the most interesting peptides, GR-44 and ER-37, representing the C-terminal region of CgA, were found to be amidated. These data would imply that the intact protein is C-terminally amidated and that these peptides are probably biologically active. The spectrum of novel CgA-derived peptides, described in the present study, should provide a basis for biological evaluation of authentic entities.},

   abstract = {Increasingly it is being recognized that matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are important processing enzymes that regulate cellular behaviour and immune cell function by selective proteolysis of cell surface receptors and adhesion molecules, cytokines and growth factors. These functions will likely prove to be as important in vivo as the proposed roles of MMPs in pathological matrix degradation. To screen for new protease substrates we have reported a novel 'exosite scanning' strategy that utilizes protease substrate-binding exosite domains as yeast two-hybrid baits. We discovered that the chemokine monocyte chemoattractant protein-3 (MCP-3) binds the hemopexin C domain of gelatinase A (MMP-2) leading to its efficient cleavage, converting an agonist to a potent receptor antagonist. We have now found that other MMPs cleave MCP-1, MCP-2, MCP-3, MCP-4, SDF-lalpha and SDF-1beta indicating that the intersection between the chemokine and MMP families is broad with important implications for the control of inflammatory and immune processes. Use of engineered substrates with altered exosite binding affinities further revealed the power of exosites in dictating proteolytic specificity - either directing cleavage of non-preferred sites or in other cases virtually eliminating proteolysis of readily accessible scissile bonds. Hence, bioinformatic searches for protease substrates based on scissile bond preference will only reveal a subset of substrates unless the influence of exosites is considered.},

This group is unrelated to the classical trypsin and subtilisin families, and includes dipeptidyl peptidase IV, acylaminoacyl peptidase and oligopeptidase B, in addition to the prototype prolyl oligopeptidase. The recent crystal structure determination of prolyl oligopeptidase (80 kDa) has shown that the enzyme contains a peptidase domain with an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, and its catalytic triad is covered by the central tunnel of an unusual seven-bladed beta-propeller. This domain operates as a gating filter, excluding large, structured peptides from the active site. The binding mode of substrates and the catalytic mechanism differ from that of the classical serine peptidases in several features. The members of the family are important targets of drug design. Prolyl oligopeptidase is involved in amnesia, depression and blood pressure control, dipeptidyl peptidase IV in type 2 diabetes and oligopeptidase B in trypanosomiasis.},

   abstract = {GOALS: The causes of Crohn's disease (CD) are still considered to be unknown. It is likely that an immune defect leads to an increase in T helper 1 (Th1) cytokine responses, which may then contribute to the characteristic morphologic changes. Increased values in distinct immune activation parameters connected with a Th1 immune response have also been found in patients who are depressed. Because various clinical observations have asserted that a depressive disposition may have some connection with the development of CD, we examined whether a relationship exists between T-cell activation parameters and depressive personality characteristics in patients with CD. STUDY: Seventy-one patients (62% women; age, 38 +/- 13 years) with CD (23 with CD Activity Index [CDAI] >150 and 48 with CDAI < or =150) were included in this study. Sixty patients were re-examined after 4.4 +/- 1.8 months. The T cell parameters CD2, CD3, CD26, CD28, and CD95 and the activity of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) in serum were examined in the peripheral blood. The patient's subjective health status was assessed by means of a standardized psychometric instrument (Short-form Inflammatory Bowel Disease Questionnaire [SIBDQ]). The presence of various characteristics indicative of a depressed mood was also assessed (Center of Epidemiological Studies-Depression Scale, Berliner Stimmungsfragebogen), as well as indicators of a personality disposed to depression (Giessentest) and a depressive illness coping strategy (Freiburger Krankheitsverarbeitungs-Fragebogen), all using the above-mentioned standardized instruments. RESULTS: The immune parameters connected with the activation of Th1 (CD25+, CD25+/CD26+) are increased in patients, depending on the stage of illness. In addition, DPP IV activity was significantly lower in patients with an active disease, as was their subjective health status (SIBDQ). A connection with an indicator of mental depression could not be found. CONCLUSION: The observed changes in immune parameters support the idea that morphologic changes could be connected with an increased Th1 response and that DPP IV activity could play an immunomodulatory role. A relationship between the measured immune parameters and individual characteristics of depression could not be found.},

   abstract = {A new instrument and method is described for laterally resolved mass spectrometric surface analysis. Fields of application are in both the life sciences and the material sciences. The instrument provides for imaging of the distribution of selected sample components from natural and artificial surfaces. Samples are either analyzed by laser desorption ionization (LDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry or, after preparation with a suitable matrix, by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry. Areas of 100 × 100 μm are scanned with minimal increments of 0.25 μm, and between 10,000 and 160,000 mass spectra are acquired per image within 3 to 50 min (scan rate up to 50 pixels per s). The effective lateral resolution is in the range of 0.6 to 1.5 μm depending on sample properties, preparation methods and laser wavelength. Optical investigation of the same sample area by UV confocal scanning laser microscopy was found to be very attractive in combination with scanning MALDI mass analysis because pixel-identical images can be created with both techniques providing for a strong increase in analytical information. This article describes the method and instrumentation, including first applicational examples in elemental analysis, imaging of pine tree roots, and investigation of MALDI sample morphology in biomolecular analysis.},

BioMOBY adds to the web services paradigm, as exemplified by Universal Data Discovery and Integration (UDDI), by having an object-driven registry query system with object and service ontologies. This allows users to traverse expansive and disparate data sets where each possible next step is presented based on the data object currently in-hand. Moreover, a path from the current data object to a desired final data object could be automatically discovered using the registry. Native BioMOBY objects are lightweight XML, and make up both the query and the response of a simple object access protocol (SOAP) transaction.},

The numerous data sets become really useful when they are interconnected under a uniform interface--representing the domain knowledge. The SRS has become an integration system for both data retrieval and applications for data analysis. It provides capabilities to search multiple databases by shared attributes and to query across databases fast and efficiently. RESULTS: Here we present recent developments at the EBI SRS server (http://srs.ebi.ac.uk). The EBI SRS server contains today more than 130 biological databases and integrates more than 10 applications. It is a central resource for molecular biology data as well as a reference server for the latest developments in data integration. One of the latest additions to the EBI SRS server is the InterPro database-Integrated Resource of Protein Domains and Functional Sites. Distributed in XML format it became a turning point in low level XML-SRS integration. We present InterProScan as an example of data analysis applications, describe some advanced features of SRS6, and introduce the SRSQuickSearch JavaScript interfaces to SRS.},

   abstract = {To examine the cleavage specificity of different members of the furin/propeptide convertase (PC) family of enzymes, we have selected proglucagon (PG) as a model substrate. PG was selected because it is subject to differential processing in vivo. PG is thought to be cleaved initially at an interdomain site to produce glicentin and the major proglucagon fragment (MPGF). These intermediates are subsequently cleaved, most likely by the convertases PC2 and PC1, respectively. To determine the exact sites within PG that are cleaved by PC1 and PC2, we attempted to produce milligram quantities of human PG, glicentin, and MPGF for use in an in vitro conversion assay. A methionine residue was added to the N-terminus of each protein to initiate translation. Purification was achieved using cation exchange and reversed-phase chromatography, and the integrity of the methionylated proteins was confirmed by both electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry and amino acid analysis. The combined expression and purification scheme is fast, efficient, and results in milligram quantities of ⩾95% pure proglucagon, ⩾95% pure MPGF, and ⩾93% pure glicentin. These prohormones are cleaved by PC1 to produce product peptides consistent with the processing of PG observed in vivo, and should therefore be suitable for further analysis of the post-translational processing of PG.},

   abstract = {Proteolysis is a regulatory step in many physiological processes, but which proteases in what cellular sites are involved in activation or degradation of which peptides is not well known. We developed a rapid assay consisting of living cells and fluorogenic protease substrates to determine which bioactive peptides are possible natural substrates of a specific protease with the multifunctional or moonlighting protein CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) as a model. CD26/DPPIV catalyzes cleavage of peptides from the amino terminus of peptides with proline at the penultimate position. Many biologically active peptides, such as beta-casomorphin1-5, contain proline in the penultimate position. We incubated living Jurkat cells, which are T cells that lack CD26/DPPIV, and CD26/DPPIV-transfected Jurkat cells in the presence of the fluorogenic substrate [Ala-Pro]2-cresyl violet (Magic Red) and beta-casomorphin1-5. Fluorescent cresyl violet was generated by CD26/DPPIV-transfected Jurkat cells but not by wild-type Jurkat cells with a Km of 3.7 microM. beta-Casomorphin1-5 appeared to be a possible natural substrate of CD26/DPPIV, because it inhibited production of fluorescence competitively (Ki = 60 microM). The assay using living cells and a fluorogenic protease substrate is an efficient system to determine whether specific peptides are possible natural substrates of a particular protease.},

   abstract = {CD26/DPPIV can be considered a moonlighting protein because it is a multifunctional protein that exerts its different functions depending on cell type and intra- or extracellular conditions in which it is expressed. In the present review, we summarize all its known functions in relation to physiological and pathophysiological conditions. The protein is a proteolytic enzyme, receptor, costimulatory protein, and is involved in adhesion and apoptosis. The CD26/DPPIV protein plays a major role in immune response. Abnormal expression is found in the case of autoimmune diseases, HIV-related diseases and cancer. Natural substrates for CD26/DPPIV are involved in immunomodulation, psycho/neuronal modulation and physiological processes in general. Therefore, targeting of CD26/ DPPIV and especially its proteolytic activity has many therapeutic potentials. On the other hand, there are homologous proteins with overlapping proteolytic activity, which thus may prevent specific modulation of CD26/DPPIV. In conclusion, CD26/DPPIV is a protein present both in various cellular compartments and extracellularly where it exerts different functions and thus is a true moonlighting protein.},

   abstract = {It is a central tenet of the epilepsy field that seizures result from the imbalance of excitation over inhibition (1). The bulk of excitation is mediated by the neurotransmitter glutamate, whereas inhibition results mainly from the actions of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). In the neocortex and hippocampus, the intrinsic sources of GABA are the interneurons, which lately have come under intense scrutiny. It has become clear that a large number of distinct types of interneurons can be differentiated in part by the array of neuropeptides they coexpress (cf. 2). Evidence is emerging that the neuropeptide complement of interneurons plays important roles in the way that interneurons regulate excitability. Here we discuss what is known about the relation of one well-characterized neuropeptide, neuropeptide Y (NPY), and epilepsy in experimental animals and humans, and suggest possible roles for the receptors as targets for the control of excessive excitation in epilepsy.},

Its unique triple-helix structure and extremely high level of crystallinity make it exceptionally efficient in generating the second harmonic of incident light, and we show here how this leads to a novel mode of microscopy of immediate practical significance in medicine and biology. In particular, it provides sensitive and high-resolution information on collagen distribution, discriminates between type I and type III collagen, and allows both a greater understanding of and a sensitive test for cirrhosis of the liver. Future research applications could include wound healing and hereditary collagen diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta.},

   abstract = {Glucagon metabolism under basal (endogenous) conditions and during intravenous glucagon infusion was studied in anesthetized pigs by use of midregion (M), COOH-terminal (C), and NH2-terminal (N)-RIAs. Arteriovenous concentration differences revealed a negative extraction of endogenous glucagon immunoreactivity across the portal bed (-35.4 +/- 11.0, -40.3 +/- 9.6, -35.6 +/- 16.9%, M-, C-, N-RIA, respectively), reflecting net secretion of pancreatic glucagon and intestinal glicentin and oxyntomodulin, but under exogenous conditions, a net extraction occurred (11.6 +/- 3.6 and 18.6 +/- 5.7%, C- and N-RIA, respectively). Hindlimb extraction of endogenous (17.4 +/- 3.7%, C-RIA) and exogenous (29.1 +/- 4.8 and 19.8 +/- 5.1%, C- and M-RIA) glucagon was detected, indicating M and C cleavage of the molecule. Renal extraction of glucagon was detected by all assays under endogenous (19.4 +/- 6.7, 33.9 +/- 7.1, 29.5 +/- 6.7%, M-, C-, N-RIA) and exogenous conditions (46.9 +/- 4.8, 46.4 +/- 6.0, 47.0 +/- 7.7%; M-, C-, N-RIA), indicating substantial elimination of the peptide. Hepatic glucagon extraction was undetectable under basal conditions and detected only by M-RIA (10.0 +/- 3.8%) during glucagon infusion, indicating limited midregional cleavage of the molecule. The plasma half-life determined by C- and N-RIAs (2.7 +/- 0.2 and 2.3 +/- 0.2 min) were similar, but both were shorter than when determined by M-RIA (3.2 +/- 0.2 min, P < 0.02). Metabolic clearance rates were similar regardless of assay (14.4 +/- 1.1, 13.6 +/- 1.7, 17.0 +/- 1.7 ml x kg-1 x min-1, M-, C-, N-RIA). Porcine plasma degraded glucagon, but this was not significantly affected by the dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) inhibitor valine-pyrrolidide, and in anesthetized pigs, glucagon's metabolic stability was unchanged by DPP IV inhibition. We conclude that tissue-specific metabolism of glucagon occurs, with the kidney being the main site of removal and the liver playing little, if any, role. Furthermore, valine-pyrrolidide has no effect on glucagon stability, suggesting that DPP IV is unimportant in glucagon metabolism in vivo, in contrast to its significant role in the metabolism of the other proglucagon-derived peptides and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide.},

   abstract = {In previous work we reported that long term treatment of polarized HT-29 cells by 1-benzyl-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-alpha-d-galactopyranoside (GalNAcalpha-O-bn) induced undersialylation and intracellular distribution of apical glycoproteins such as dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), and we suggested therefore that sialylation could act as an apical targeting signal. In this work, the apical direct biosynthetic route was studied after transfection of polarized enterocyte-like HT-29 5M12 cloned cells with a murine cDNA coding for a soluble form of DPP-IV, which was secreted into the apical medium. A 24-h treatment of transfected cells by GalNAcalpha-O-bn markedly inhibited the apical secretion and the sialylation of this soluble murine DPP-IV, which became blocked inside the cell. A similar short GalNAcalpha-O-bn treatment also induced an intracellular distribution of both endogenous transmembrane DPP-IV and proteins involved in the regulation of the apical trafficking such as the apical t-SNARE syntaxin-3 and the raft-associated protein annexin XIIIb, whereas the basolateral t-SNARE syntaxin-4 kept its normal localization. These apical membrane proteins moved efficiently from trans-Golgi network to apical carrier vesicles but failed to be transported from carrier vesicles to the apical plasma membrane. Isolation of membrane microdomains showed that GalNAcalpha-O-bn induced the formation of abnormal lipid-rich microdomains in comparison to normal rafts, as shown by their lower buoyant density and their depletion in annexin XIIIb. In conclusion, GalNAcalpha-O-bn blocks the anterograde traffic to the apical surface of polarized HT-29 cells at the transport level or docking/fusion level of carrier vesicles.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a serine protease, a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) family, and has been implicated in several diseases. Therefore, the development of DPPIV selective inhibitors, which are able to control the biological function of DPPIV, is important. We determined the crystal structure of human DPPIV at 2.6A resolution. The molecule consists of a unique eight-bladed beta-propeller domain in the N-terminal region and a serine protease domain in the C-terminal region. Also, the large "cave" structure, which is thought to control the access of the substrate, is found on the side of the beta-propeller fold. Comparison of the overall amino acid sequence between human DPPIV and POP shows low homology (12.9%). In this paper, we report the structure of human DPPIV, especially focusing on a unique eight-bladed beta-propeller domain. We also discuss the way for the access of the substrate to this domain.},

   abstract = {Growth and metastasis of solid neoplasms require the recruitment of a supporting tumor stroma. A highly consistent trait of tumor stromal fibroblasts in most epithelial cancers is the induction of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a member of the serine protease family. Recently it was demonstrated that FAP has both dipeptidyl peptidase and collagenolytic activity capable of degrading gelatin and type I collagen. In this study, we describe the expression and enzyme activity of FAP in benign and malignant melanocytic skin tumors. FAP-positive fibroblasts were detected immunohistochemically in the reactive stroma of all melanocytic nevi tested. In primary and metastatic melanomas an upregulation of FAP expression in the reactive mesenchyme could be observed. Whereas 30% of the nevi revealed additional FAP expression on subsets of melanocytic cells, melanoma cells from primary and metastatic melanomas were FAP negative. This may indicate a possible role for FAP in the control of tumor cell growth and proliferation during melanoma carcinogenesis. Consistent with this in vivo expression pattern FAP enzyme activity could be detected by a specific immunocapture assay in extracts of melanocytic nevi and melanoma metastases, whereas no significant activity was detectable in normal adult skin. Strong protein expression of FAP was observed in patterned structures restricted to a subset of the melanoma metastases. Our findings that these FAP-positive structures showed no overlap with endothelial cell surface markers, nor with various melanoma antigens, suggest that FAP is a marker for specific stromal-cell-derived patterns in cutaneous melanoma metastases.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl-peptidase IV/CD26 (DPP IV) is a cell-surface protease belonging to the prolyloligopeptidase family. It selectively removes the N-terminal dipeptide from peptides with proline or alanine in the second position. Apart from its catalytic activity, it interacts with several proteins, for instance, adenosine deaminase, the HIV gp120 protein, fibronectin, collagen, the chemokine receptor CXCR4, and the tyrosine phosphatase CD45. DPP IV is expressed on a specific set of T lymphocytes, where it is up-regulated after activation. It is also expressed in a variety of tissues, primarily on endothelial and epithelial cells. A soluble form is present in plasma and other body fluids. DPP IV has been proposed as a diagnostic or prognostic marker for various tumors, hematological malignancies, immunological, inflammatory, psychoneuroendocrine disorders, and viral infections. DPP IV truncates many bioactive peptides of medical importance. It plays a role in glucose homeostasis through proteolytic inactivation of the incretins. DPP IV inhibitors improve glucose tolerance and pancreatic islet cell function in animal models of type 2 diabetes and in diabetic patients. The role of DPP IV/ CD26 within the immune system is a combination of its exopeptidase activity and its interactions with different molecules. This enables DPP IV/CD26 to serve as a co-stimulatory molecule to influence T cell activity and to modulate chemotaxis. DPP IV is also implicated in HIV-1 entry, malignant transformation, and tumor invasion.},

   abstract = {The chemokines CXCL9/Mig, CXCL10/IP-10, and CXCL11/I-TAC regulate lymphocyte chemotaxis, mediate vascular pericyte proliferation, and act as angiostatic agents, thus inhibiting tumor growth. These multiple activities are apparently mediated by a unique G protein-coupled receptor, termed CXCR3. The chemokine CXCL4/PF4 shares several activities with CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, including a powerful angiostatic effect, but its specific receptor is still unknown. Here, we describe a distinct, previously unrecognized receptor named CXCR3-B, derived from an alternative splicing of the CXCR3 gene that mediates the angiostatic activity of CXCR3 ligands and also acts as functional receptor for CXCL4. Human microvascular endothelial cell line-1 (HMEC-1), transfected with either the known CXCR3 (renamed CXCR3-A) or CXCR3-B, bound CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11, whereas CXCL4 showed high affinity only for CXCR3-B. Overexpression of CXCR3-A induced an increase of survival, whereas overexpression of CXCR3-B dramatically reduced DNA synthesis and up-regulated apoptotic HMEC-1 death through activation of distinct signal transduction pathways. Remarkably, primary cultures of human microvascular endothelial cells, whose growth is inhibited by CXCL9, CXCL10, CXCL11, and CXCL4, expressed CXCR3-B, but not CXCR3-A. Finally, monoclonal antibodies raised to selectively recognize CXCR3-B reacted with endothelial cells from neoplastic tissues, providing evidence that CXCR3-B is also expressed in vivo and may account for the angiostatic effects of CXC chemokines.},

The combination of function- or structure-based purification of modified 'subproteomes', such as phosphorylated proteins or modified membrane proteins, with mass spectrometry is proving particularly successful. To map modification sites in molecular detail, novel mass spectrometric peptide sequencing and analysis technologies hold tremendous potential. Finally, stable isotope labeling strategies in combination with mass spectrometry have been applied successfully to study the dynamics of modifications.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Seprase is an integral membrane serine proteinase with gelatinase activity that may be involved in cancer invasion and metastasis. However, the pathophysiologic significance of its expression in gastric cancer tissue has not been fully elucidated. METHODS: Seprase expression and distribution in gastric cancer specimens obtained from 133 patients were examined by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. RESULTS: Immunohistochemistry showed that in intestinal-type cancer, which includes well and moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma, seprase immunoreactivity was mainly recognized in the moderately differentiated cells and not in the well differentiated cells. In the diffuse type, which includes poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma and signet ring cell carcinoma, seprase immunoreactivity was seen mainly in cells with poor cell-to-cell junctions. The reactive pattern in the cells was different between moderately differentiated adenocarcinoma and diffuse-type carcinoma. Besides the cytoplasm, the cell membrane also apparently reacted in the former, while only the cytoplasm reacted diffusely in the latter. Seprase immunoreactivity was also recognized in endothelial cells and stromal cells especially adjacent to tumor nests. The immunoreactivity of the stromal cells was more abundant in the intestinal type than in the diffuse type, and these stromal expressions of seprase in the intestinal type correlated with the liver (13/13 = 100% of cases with metastases) or lymph node metastases (33/34 = 97% of cases with metastases). Immunoblotting showed that the levels of seprase protein were higher in intestinal-type cancer than in diffuse-type cancer. CONCLUSION: These results suggested that there is a difference in seprase expression between intestinal- and diffuse-type gastric cancer; this difference may reflect distinct biological features of these types of cancer.},

Thus to investigate the effects of polyphenols on bradykinin activity and structure, we studied the interaction in the structuring solvent DMSO which can be a close mimic of aqueous physiological environments like receptor-binding sites. Bradykinin alone presented a folded structure with two turns.

Numerous studies have shown that polyphenolic molecules can act upon various biological targets, and the formation of this type of complex might be one of the possible modes of action.

Once integrated, these tools can be used to compose reusable workflows using these services that can later be deployed as new services for others to use. Using the Discovery Net system and a range of different bioinformatics tools, we built a Grid based application for Genome Annotation. This includes workflows for automatic nucleotide annotation, annotation of predicted proteins and text analysis based on metabolic profiles and text analysis.},

   abstract = {Endomorphin-2 (Tyr-Pro-Phe-PheNH(2)) was discovered as an endogenous ligand for the mu-opioid receptor. The physiological function of endomorphin-2 as a neurotransmitter or neuromodulator may cease through the rapid enzymatic process in the synapse of brain, as for other neuropeptides. The present study was conducted to examine the metabolism of endomorphin-2 by synaptic membranes prepared from mouse brain. Major metabolites were free tyrosine, free phenylalanine, Tyr-Pro and PheNH(2). Both the degradation of endomorphin-2 and the accumulation of major metabolites were inhibited by specific inhibitors of dipeptidyl peptidase IV, such as diprotin A and B. On the other hand, the accumulation of Phe-PheNH(2) and Pro-Phe-PheNH(2) was increased in the presence of bestatin, an aminopeptidase inhibitor, whereas that of free phenylalanine and PheNH(2), was decreased. Furthermore, purified dipeptidyl peptidase IV hydrolyzed endomorphin-2 at the cleavage site, Pro(2)-Phe(3) bond. Thus, degradation of endomorphin-2 by brain synaptic membranes seems to take place mainly through the cleavage of Pro(2)-Phe(3) bond by dipeptidyl peptidase IV, followed by release of free phenylalanine and PheNH(2) from the liberated fragment, Phe-PheNH, by aminopeptidase. We have also examined that the effect of diprotin A on the antinociception induced by intracerebroventricularly administered endomorphin-2 in the mouse paw withdrawal test. Diprotin A simultaneously injected with endomorphin-2 enhanced endomorphin-2-induced antinociception. These results indicate that dipeptidyl peptidase IV may be an important peptidase responsible for terminating endomorphin-2-induced antinociception at the supraspinal level in mice.

Although applicable to any system of molecular components and interactions, Cytoscape is most powerful when used in conjunction with large databases of protein-protein, protein-DNA, and genetic interactions that are increasingly available for humans and model organisms. Cytoscape's software Core provides basic functionality to layout and query the network; to visually integrate the network with expression profiles, phenotypes, and other molecular states; and to link the network to databases of functional annotations. The Core is extensible through a straightforward plug-in architecture, allowing rapid development of additional computational analyses and features. Several case studies of Cytoscape plug-ins are surveyed, including a search for interaction pathways correlating with changes in gene expression, a study of protein complexes involved in cellular recovery to DNA damage, inference of a combined physical/functional interaction network for Halobacterium, and an interface to detailed stochastic/kinetic gene regulatory models.},

Increased sensitivity in mass spectrometry, as a result of more efficient ionisation techniques and better detectors, has allowed the stepwise reduction of protein quantity for analysis. Protein spots of 2D-PAGE separated samples are now quantitatively sufficient for an unequivocal identification of a protein by mass spectrometry. In addition to protein identification a closer look at posttranslational modifications is now also possible. It is speculated that modifications like phosphorylation or glycosylation exist on every second protein and that they are important for the protein function. This review highlights the different mass spectrometric methods and gives a brief overview of strategies and methods used to identify modifications.},

We expressed and purified the ectodomain of human DPP-IV in Pichia pastoris and determined the X-ray structure at 2.1 Angstrom resolution. The enzyme consists of two domains, the catalytic domain, with an alpha/beta hydrolase fold, and a beta propeller domain with an 8-fold repeat of a four-strand beta sheet motif. The beta propeller domain contributes two important functions to the molecule that have not been reported for such structures, an extra beta sheet motif that forms part of the dimerization interface and an additional short helix with a double Glu sequence motif. The Glu motif provides recognition and a binding site for the N terminus of the substrates, as revealed by the complex structure with diprotin A, a substrate with low turnover that is trapped in the tetrahedral intermediate of the reaction in the crystal.},

   abstract = {To investigate the role of CD26 in the immune system, CD26 gene knockout mice with C57BL/6 background were used to study the immune response after stimulation with PWM. CD26(-/-) mice display an apparently normal phenotype. However, in their spleen lymphocyte population the percentage of CD4(+) T cells is lower, and that of NK cells is higher, than that in CD26(+/+) mice. In their peripheral blood, CD26(-/-) mice present a conspicuously decreased proportion of CD4(+) NKT lymphocytes. In vitro, the PWM-stimulated IL-4 production was decreased by 60-80% in the supernatants of spleen lymphocytes of CD26(-/-) mice compared to that of CD26(+/+) mice, whereas levels of IL-10 and IFN-gamma were increased. No significant differences were found in the production of IL-2, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-13 between knockout and wild-type mice. After immunization of mice with PWM in vivo, serum levels of total IgG, IgG1, IgG2a and IgE were markedly lower in CD26(-/-) mice than those in CD26(+/+) mice, while no difference was found in IgM production. Further analysis of cytokine levels in vivo revealed a reduced IL-4, IL-2 and delayed IFN-gamma production in sera of CD26(-/-) mice upon immunization with PWM. These results indicate that CD26 contributes to the regulation of development, maturation and migration of CD4(+) T, NK and NKT cells, cytokine secretion, T cell-dependent antibody production and immunoglobulin isotype switching of B cells.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP-IV) is a cell surface serine dipeptidase that is involved in the regulation of the incretin hormones, glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP). There is accumulating evidence that other members of the glucagon family of peptides are also endogenous substrates for this enzyme. To identify candidate substrates for DP-IV, a mass spectrometry-based protease assay was developed that measures cleavage efficiencies (kcat/Km) of polypeptides in a mixture, using only a few picomoles of each substrate and physiological amounts of enzyme in a single kinetic experiment. Oxyntomodulin and the growth hormone-(1-43) fragment were identified as new candidate in vivo substrates. Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide-(1-38) (PACAP38), a critical mediator of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, was also determined to be efficiently processed by DP-IV in vitro. The catabolism of exogenously administered PACAP38 in wild type and DP-IV-deficient C57Bl/6 mice was monitored by tandem mass spectrometry. Animals lacking DP-IV exhibited a significantly slower clearance of the circulating peptide with virtually complete suppression of the inactive DP-IV metabolite, PACAP-(3-38). These in vivo results suggest that DP-IV plays a major role in the degradation of circulating PACAP38.},

   abstract = {The type II transmembrane serine protease dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), also known as CD26 or adenosine deaminase binding protein, is a major regulator of various physiological processes, including immune, inflammatory, nervous, and endocrine functions. It has been generally accepted that glycosylation of DPPIV and of other transmembrane dipeptidyl peptidases is a prerequisite for enzyme activity and correct protein folding. Crystallographic studies on DPPIV reveal clear N-linked glycosylation of nine Asn residues in DPPIV. However, the importance of each glycosylation site on physiologically relevant reactions such as dipeptide cleavage, dimer formation, and adenosine deaminase (ADA) binding remains obscure. Individual Asn-->Ala point mutants were introduced at the nine glycosylation sites in the extracellular domain of DPPIV (residues 39-766). Crystallographic and biochemical data demonstrate that N-linked glycosylation of DPPIV does not contribute significantly to its peptidase activity. The kinetic parameters of dipeptidyl peptidase cleavage of wild-type DPPIV and the N-glycosylation site mutants were determined by using Ala-Pro-AFC and Gly-Pro-pNA as substrates and varied by <50%. DPPIV is active as a homodimer. Size-exclusion chromatographic analysis showed that the glycosylation site mutants do not affect dimerization. ADA binds to the highly glycosylated beta-propeller domain of DPPIV, but the impact of glycosylation on binding had not previously been determined. Our studies indicate that glycosylation of DPPIV is not required for ADA binding. Taken together, these data indicate that in contrast to the generally accepted view, glycosylation of DPPIV is not a prerequisite for catalysis, dimerization, or ADA binding.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a member of the prolyl oligopeptidase family of serine proteases. DPPIV removes dipeptides from the N terminus of substrates, including many chemokines, neuropeptides, and peptide hormones. Specific inhibition of DPPIV is being investigated in human trials for the treatment of type II diabetes. To understand better the molecular determinants that underlie enzyme catalysis and substrate specificity, we report the crystal structures of DPPIV in the free form and in complex with the first 10 residues of the physiological substrate, Neuropeptide Y (residues 1-10; tNPY). The crystal structure of the free form of the enzyme reveals two potential channels through which substrates could access the active site-a so-called propeller opening, and side opening. The crystal structure of the DPPIV/tNPY complex suggests that bioactive peptides utilize the side opening unique to DPPIV to access the active site. Other structural features in the active site such as the presence of a Glu motif, a well-defined hydrophobic S1 subsite, and minimal long-range interactions explain the substrate recognition and binding properties of DPPIV. Moreover, in the DPPIV/tNPY complex structure, the peptide is not cleaved but trapped in a tetrahedral intermediate that occurs during catalysis. Conformational changes of S630 and H740 between DPPIV in its free form and in complex with tNPY were observed and contribute to the stabilization of the tetrahedral intermediate. Our results facilitate the design of potent, selective small molecule inhibitors of DPPIV that may yield compounds for the development of novel drugs to treat type II diabetes.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To assess the 12- and 52-week efficacy of the dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor LAF237 versus placebo in patients with type 2 diabetes continuing metformin treatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a 12-week, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial in 107 patients with type 2 diabetes with a 40-week extension in those completing the core study and agreeing, together with the investigator, to extend treatment to 1 year. Placebo (n=51) or LAF237 (50 mg once daily, n=56) was added to ongoing metformin treatment (1,500-3,000 mg/day). HbA1c and fasting plasma glucose (FPG) were measured periodically, and standardized meal tests were performed at baseline, week 12, and week 52. RESULTS: In patients randomized to LAF237, baseline HbA1c averaged 7.7 +/- 0.1% and decreased at week 12 (Delta=-0.6 +/- 0.1%), whereas HbA1c did not change from a baseline of 7.9 +/- 0.1% in patients given placebo (between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c=-0.7 +/- 0.1%, P <0.0001). Mean prandial glucose and FPG were significantly reduced in patients receiving LAF237 versus placebo by 2.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P <0.0001) and 1.2 +/- 0.4 mmol/l (P=0.0057), respectively, but plasma insulin levels were not affected. At end point of the extension, the between-group differences in change in mean prandial glucose, insulin, and FPG were -2.4 +/- 0.6 mmol/l (P=0.0001), 40 +/- 16 pmol/l (P=0.0153), and -1.1 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (P=0.0312), respectively. HbA1c did not change from week 12 to week 52 in LAF237-treated patients (n=42) but increased in participants given placebo (n=29). The between-group difference in DeltaHbA1c after 1 year was -1.1 +/- 0.2% (P <0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Data from this study demonstrate that LAF237 effectively prevents deterioration of glycemic control when added to metformin monotherapy in type 2 diabetes.},

A short cDNA of 2589 bp and a long cDNA of 3006 bp of DP9 were cloned. A ubiquitous predominant DP9 mRNA transcript at 4.4 kb represented the short form, whereas a less abundant 5.0-kb transcript present predominantly in muscle represented the long form. Both forms of DP9 have no transmembrane domain and two potential N-linked glycosylation sites. DP9 exhibited post-proline dipeptidyl aminopeptidase activity and was a cytoplasmic, 110-kDa monomer. Thus, the six DPIV gene family members have diverse characteristics: only DP9 and DP8 have exclusively cytoplasmic localization and only DP9, DP8, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and DPIV have peptidase activity.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND & AIMS: Gut-derived peptides including ghrelin, cholecystokinin (CCK), peptide YY (PYY), glucagon-like peptide (GLP-1), and GLP-2 exert overlapping actions on energy homeostasis through defined G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). The proglucagon-derived peptide (PGDP) oxyntomodulin (OXM) is cosecreted with GLP-1 and inhibits feeding in rodents and humans; however, a distinct receptor for OXM has not been identified. METHODS: We examined the mechanisms mediating oxyntomodulin action using stable cell lines expressing specific PGDP receptors in vitro and both wild-type and knockout mice in vivo. RESULTS: OXM activates signaling pathways in cells through glucagon or GLP-1 receptors (GLP-1R) but transiently inhibits food intake in vivo exclusively through the GLP-1R. Both OXM and the GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 (Ex-4) activated neuronal c-fos expression in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus, the area postrema, and the nucleus of the solitary tract following intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. However, OXM transiently inhibited food intake in wild-type mice following intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) but not i.p. administration, whereas Ex-4 produced a more potent and sustained inhibition of food intake following both i.c.v. and i.p. administration. The anorectic effects of OXM were preserved in Gcgr(-/-) mice but abolished in GLP-1R(-/-) mice. Although central Ex-4 and OXM inhibited feeding via a GLP-1R-dependent mechanism, Ex-4 but not OXM reduced VO2 and respiratory quotient in wild-type mice. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that structurally distinct PGDPs differentially regulate food intake and energy expenditure by interacting with a GLP-1R-dependent pathway. Hence ligand-specific activation of a common GLP-1R increases the complexity of gut-central nervous system pathways regulating energy homeostasis and metabolic expenditure.},

   abstract = {Objectives We hypothesized that B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) levels can predict cardiac mortality in diabetic patients. Background Detection of cardiovascular disease in diabetics can be difficult until overt events occur. Methods A total of 482 diabetics (majority male with type 2 diabetes) at the Veterans Affairs Medical Center San Diego were divided into two groups: 1) referred patients for echocardiogram on the basis of clinical suspicion of cardiac dysfunction (referred [R], n = 180); 2) patients randomly selected from the diabetic clinic without any suspicion of cardiac dysfunction (not referred [N-R], n = 302). We examined cardiac events and all-cause mortality in relation to initial BNP levels during the follow-up. Results A total of 71 (14.7%) patients died during this period: 52 of 180 (29%) in the R group (30 of 52 [58%] cardiac, 10 of 52 [19%] non-cardiac, 2 of 52 [4%] renal, 10 of 52 [19%] unknown cause) and 19 of 302 (6%) in N-R group (6 of 19 [32%] cardiac). The median BNP level in the R and N-R groups who died of cardiac, non-cardiac, and unknown cause was 537 and 87, 80 and 53, and 343 and 38 pg/ml, respectively. The receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) values for mortality in two groups in relation to BNP revealed the area under the curve to be 0.720 and 0.691, respectively (p < 0.01 in both). Among commonly used prognostic indicators in diabetics, only the ROC for triglycerides was significant. The most accurate cut-point in both the N-R group (87%) and R group (61%) was 120 pg/ml of BNP. Cox regression analysis showed BNP to be the most significant predictor of all-cause mortality in the R group. There was a marked decrease in survival in the patient group with BNP >120 pg/ml. Conclusions B-type natriuretic peptide appears to be a reliable predictor of future cardiac and all-cause mortality in diabetic patients.},

DPP8 catalyzes the cleavage at the carboxyl side of the proline residue at the penultimate position. To study its structure and biochemical properties, we have overexpressed the human DPP8 protein in baculovirus infected Sf9 cells. The protein is soluble and can be purified to homogeneity. Using the chromogenic H-Gly-Pro-pNA as the substrate, a kinetic study shows that purified DPP8 is active and has a similar kcat value as that of DPP-IV, a prolyl dipeptidase that is a drug target for type II diabetes. The kinetic constants of DPP8 are also determined for other chromogenic substrates, and the results indicate that DPP8 has substrate preference at both the P1 and P2 sites. The expression system provides means of better understanding the structure, catalytic mechanism, and biological function of DPP8 protein.},

   abstract = {DPP-IV is a prolyl dipeptidase, cleaving the peptide bond after the penultimate proline residue. It is an important drug target for the treatment of type II diabetes. DPP-IV is active as a dimer, and monomeric DPP-IV has been speculated to be inactive. In this study, we have identified the C-terminal loop of DPP-IV, highly conserved among prolyl dipeptidases, as essential for dimer formation and optimal catalysis. The conserved residue His750 on the loop contributes significantly for dimer stability. We have determined the quaternary structures of the wild type, H750A, and H750E mutant enzymes by several independent methods including chemical cross-linking, gel electrophoresis, size exclusion chromatography, and analytical ultracentrifugation. Wild-type DPP-IV exists as dimers both in the intact cell and in vitro after purification from human semen or insect cells. The H750A mutation results in a mixture of DPP-IV dimer and monomer. H750A dimer has the same kinetic constants as those of the wild type, whereas the H750A monomer has a 60-fold decrease in kcat. Replacement of His750 with a negatively charged Glu (H750E) results in nearly exclusive monomers with a 300-fold decrease in catalytic activity. Interestingly, there is no dynamic equilibrium between the dimer and the monomer for all forms of DPP-IVs studied here. This is the first study of the function of the C-terminal loop as well as monomeric mutant DPP-IVs with respect to their enzymatic activities. The study has important implications for the discovery of drugs targeted to the dimer interface.},

In this paper, we report an inhibitory effect of these peptides on dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity, known to be involved in regulatory functions such as the activation or inactivation of peptides. The structure activity research revealed that hemorphins N-terminus sequence influences nature of the interaction between hemorphins and DPPIV. Kinetic studies conducted with purified DPPIV demonstrated that hemorphin-7 (H7) constitutes a good substrate (K(cat)/K(m) of 137 mM(-1) s(-1)) for this enzyme but could also act as a selective competitive inhibitor by substrate binding site competition. These blood-derived peptides could represent endogenous regulators of this enzyme activity.},

   abstract = {The chemokine stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1), which is constitutively expressed in most tissues as SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta resulting from alternative gene splicing, regulates hematopoiesis, lymphocyte homing, B-lineage cell growth, and angiogenesis. Because SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta are constitutively and ubiquitously expressed, their degradation must serve an important regulatory role. Here we show that SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta are secreted as full-length molecules. When exposed to human serum, full-length SDF-1alpha (1-68) undergoes processing first at the COOH terminus to produce SDF-1alpha 1-67 and then at the NH2 terminus to produce SDF-1alpha 3-67. By contrast, full-length SDF-1beta (1-72) is processed only at the NH2 terminus to produce SDF-1beta 3-72. CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase is responsible for serum cleavage of SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta at the NH2 terminus. Serum processing of SDF-1alpha at the COOH terminus, which has not been previously reported, reduces the ability of the polypeptide to bind to heparin and to cells and to stimulate B-cell proliferation and chemotaxis. The additional processing at the NH2 terminus renders both forms of SDF-1 unable to bind to heparin and to activate cells. The differential processing of SDF-1alpha and SDF-1beta provides biologic significance to the existence of 2 splice forms of the chemokine and adds a tool to precisely regulate SDF-1's biologic activity by changes in specific activity.},

Shortly thereafter, NPY was found to be a member of a peptide family consisting of the endocrine peptides pancreatic polypeptide (PP) and peptide YY (PYY). These peptides exert most of their biological effects through five G-protein coupled receptors termed Y1, Y2, Y4, Y5 and y6 that mediate either inhibition adenylate cyclase or increases in intracellular calcium. Since the discovery of NPY, a robust a body of literature has developed around the potential functions of this peptide. While initial findings identified NPY is an important contributor to the regulation of feeding, body weight and blood pressure, more recent work as revealed more subtle functions of this peptide and its potential role in affective disorders, bone formation and cravings. The accompanying twelve reviews detail important developments in our understanding of the functional role of NPY.},

   abstract = {NPY antagonizes behavioral consequences of stress through actions within the brain. Behavioral anti-stress actions of NPY are noteworthy in that (1) their magnitude surpasses that of other endogenous compounds; (2) they are produced across a wide range of animal models, normally thought to reflect different aspects of emotionality. This suggests that NPY acts with a high potency on a common core mechanism of emotionality and behavioral stress responses. Behavioral studies in genetically modified animals support this hypothesis. Increased emotionality is seen upon inactivation of NPY transmission, while the opposite is found when NPY signalling is made overactive. Several brain structures are involved in mediating anti-stress actions of NPY, with the most extensive evidence available for amygdala and hippocampus, and some evidence for regions within the septum, and locus coeruleus. Antistress actions of NPY are mimicked by Y1-receptor agonists, and blocked by Y1 antagonists, although Y5 receptors may substitute for Y1 actions in some cases. Blockade of Y2 receptors produces anti-stress effects indistinguishable from those produced by Y1 agonism, presumably through potentiation of presynaptic release of endogenous NPY. Together, available data point to the potential of the NPY system as a target for novel pharmacological treatments of stress-related disorders, including anxiety and depression. Development of Y2 antagonists presently appears to offer the most promising strategy for developing these clinical treatments.},

In addition, histamine has been suggested to be a neurotransmitter in the mammalian brain that regulates many brain functions. We have recently found evidence of the role of brain histamine in schizophrenia in basic and clinical studies. Methamphetamine-induced behavioral sensitization, which has been well established as the animal model of schizophrenia, induced the enhanced histamine release, and histamine agonists inhibited the development of behavioral sensitization. As another animal model of schizophrenia, phencyclidine also increased the histamine release. In clinical studies, the levels of N-tele-methylhistamine, a major brain histamine metabolite, were elevated in the cerebrospinal fluid of schizophrenics. Moreover, H(1) receptor binding sites decreased in schizophrenics. Many atypical antipsychotics also increased histamine turnovers. Therefore, the dysfunction of the histamine neuron system may participate in the extradopaminergic brain dysfunction of schizophrenia, and histamine agents may improve the refractory schizophrenia.},

   abstract = {Many naturally occurring peptides exhibit a high degree of promiscuity across G-protein coupled receptor subtypes. The degree to which this phenomenon occurs, and its physiological significance is not well characterized. In addition, many 'orphan' peptides exist for which there are no known receptors. Therefore, to identify novel interactions between biologically active peptides and G-protein coupled receptors, a library of nearly 200 peptides was screened against the human calcitonin (hCTr), human Parathyroid Hormone (PTH1R), human Corticotropin Releasing Factor (CRF1), and the human Glucagon-like peptide (GLP1) receptors using a cell-based functional assay (Receptor Selection and Amplification Technology). Functional profiling revealed that the 'orphan peptide' PHM-27 selectively activated the hCTr; no activity was observed at the PTH1, CRF1, or GLP1 receptors. PHM-27 was a potent agonist at the hCTr, with similar efficacy as human calcitonin, and a potency of 11 nM. These results were confirmed in cyclic AMP assays. Responses to calcitonin and PHM-27 could be suppressed by the antagonist salmon calcitonin (8-32). In competition binding studies, salmon calcitonin (8-32), calcitonin, and PHM-27 were each able to inhibit (125)I-calcitonin from cell membranes containing transiently expressed hCTr. These results indicate that the orphan peptide PHM-27 is a potent agonist at the hCTr.},

   abstract = {The catestatin fragment of chromogranin A is an endogenous inhibitor of nicotinic cholinergic transmission, functioning in negative feedback control of catecholamine secretion. We explored naturally occurring polymorphisms in the amino acid sequence of catestatin. Three human variants were identified: Gly364Ser, Pro370Leu, and Arg374Gln. Variants were tested for ability to inhibit four nicotinic processes. The rank order of potency for inhibition of catecholamine secretion was Pro370Leu > wild type > Gly364Ser > Arg374Gln. Decrease in potency was paralleled by decline in Hill slope, suggesting that negative cooperativity at ascending dose might underlie loss of potency. Several lines of evidence indicated that each variant acted as a nicotinic antagonist: potency to inhibit secretion paralleled inhibition of agonist-triggered (22)Na(+) uptake (r = 0.986); variants inhibited secretion with similar potency when triggered by several nicotinic agonists, though not by agents using other secretory pathways or bypassing the nicotinic receptor; and blockade of secretion was noncompetitive with agonist. Variants also inhibited desensitization of secretion after prior agonist exposure and stimulation of secretory protein biosynthesis by agonist. Rank order of variant inhibitory potency for all four nicotinic processes was identical (Pro370Leu > wild type > Gly364Ser > Arg374Gln), suggesting mediation by similar combinations of receptor alpha/beta subunits and that crucial catestatin residues are likely to be identical across the four processes. When catestatin variants were mixed in likely heterozygotic (1:1 M ratio) combinations, the inhibitory curve was left-shifted onto that of the more potent variant in the combination, suggesting phenotypic dominance. The results have quantitative implications for interindividual variations in human nicotinic signaling.},

   abstract = {Skilful surgery combined with blood-saving methods and careful management of blood coagulation will all help reduce unnecessary blood loss and transfusion requirements. Excessive surgical bleeding causes hypovolaemia, haemodynamic instability, anaemia and reduced oxygen delivery to tissues, with a subsequent increase in postoperative morbidity and mortality. The role of anaesthetists in managing surgical blood loss has increased greatly in the last decade. Position of the patient during surgery and the provision of a hypotensive anaesthetic regimen were once considered the most important contributions of the anaesthetist to decreasing blood loss. Now, several pharmacological haemostatic agents are being used by anaesthetists as blood-saving agents. After a brief discussion of the physiology of haemostasis, this article will review the evidence for the role of such agents in reducing perioperative blood loss and transfusion requirements.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Since insulin secretion in response to exogenous gastric inhibitory polypeptide (GIP) is diminished not only in patients with type 2 diabetes, but also in their normal glucose-tolerant first-degree relatives, it was the aim to investigate the integrity of the entero-insular axis in such subjects. METHODS: Sixteen first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes (4 male, 12 female, age 50+/-12 years, BMI 26.1+/-3.8 kg/m(2)) and 10 matched healthy controls (negative family history, 6 male, 4 female, 45+/-13 years, 26.1+/-4.2 kg/m(2)) were examined with an oral glucose load (75 g) and an "isoglycaemic" intravenous glucose infusion. Blood was drawn over 240 min for plasma glucose (glucose oxidase), insulin, C-peptide, GIP and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1; specific immunoassays). RESULTS: The pattern of glucose concentrations could precisely be copied by the intravenous glucose infusion (p=0.99). Insulin secretion was stimulated significantly more by oral as compared to intravenous glucose in both groups (p<0.0001). The percent contribution of the incretin effect was similar in both groups (C-peptide: 61.9+/-5.4 vs. 64.4+/-5.8%; p=0.77; insulin: 74.2+/-3.3 vs. 75.8+/-4.9; p=0.97; in first-degree relatives and controls, respectively). The individual responses of GIP and GLP-1 secretion were significantly correlated with each other (p=0.0003). The individual secretion of both GIP and GLP-1 was identified as a strong predictor of the integrated incremental insulin secretory responses as well as of the incretin effect. CONCLUSION/INTERPRETATION: Despite a lower insulin secretory response to exogenous GIP, incretin effects are similar in first-degree relatives of patients with type 2 diabetes and control subjects. This may be the result of a B cell secretory defect that affects stimulation by oral and intravenous glucose to a similar degree. Nevertheless, endogenous secretion of GIP and GLP-1 is a major determinant of insulin secretion after oral glucose.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a T cell costimulatory molecule with dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity in its extracellular region. We previously reported that recombinant soluble CD26 enhanced T cell proliferation induced by the recall antigen tetanus toxoid (TT). However, the mechanism involved in this enhancement is not yet elucidated. We now demonstrate that CD26 binds Caveolin-1 on antigen-presenting cells, and that residues 201-211 of CD26 along with the serine catalytic site at residue 630 contribute to binding to caveolin-1 scaffolding domain. In addition, after CD26-caveolin-1 interaction on TT-loaded monocytes, caveolin-1 is phosphorylated, which links to activate NF-kappaB, followed by up-regulation of CD86. Finally, reduced caveolin-1 expression on monocytes inhibits CD26-mediated CD86 up-regulation and abrogates CD26 effect on TT-induced T cell proliferation. Taken together, these results strongly suggest that CD26-caveolin-1 interaction plays a role in the up-regulation of CD86 on TT-loaded monocytes and subsequent engagement with CD28 on T cells, leading to antigen-specific T cell activation.},

   abstract = {The analysis of proteomes of biological organisms represents a major challenge of the post-genome era. Classical proteomics combines two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) and mass spectrometry (MS) for the identification of proteins. Novel technologies such as isotope coded affinity tag (ICAT)-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC/MS) open new insights into protein alterations. The vast amount and diverse types of proteomic data require adequate web-accessible computational and database technologies for storage, integration, dissemination, analysis and visualization. A proteome database system (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE) for microbial research has been constructed which integrates 2-DE/MS, ICAT-LC/MS and functional classification data of proteins with genomic, metabolic and other biological knowledge sources. The two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis database delivers experimental data on microbial proteins including mass spectra for the validation of protein identification. The ICAT-LC/MS database comprises experimental data for protein alterations of mycobacterial strains BCG vs. H37Rv. By formulating complex queries within a functional protein classification database “FUNC_CLASS” for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Helicobacter pylori the researcher can gather precise information on genes, proteins, protein classes and metabolic pathways. The use of the R language in the database architecture allows high-level data analysis and visualization to be performed “on-the-fly”. The database system is centrally administrated, and investigators without specific bioinformatic competence in database construction can submit their data. The database system also serves as a template for a prototype of a European Proteome Database of Pathogenic Bacteria. Currently, the database system includes proteome information for six strains of microorganisms.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP) is a cell surface serine protease expressed at sites of tissue remodeling in embryonic development. FAP is not expressed by mature somatic tissues except activated melanocytes and fibroblasts in wound healing or tumor stroma. FAP expression is specifically silenced in proliferating melanocytic cells during malignant transformation. To study the role of FAP as a tumor suppressor, the gene for mouse fap was cloned and mutated at the catalytic domain (FAP serine mutant, FSM). We found that expression of FAP or FSM at physiologic levels in mouse melanoma cells abrogated tumorigenicity. Remarkably, the mutant form FSM lacking specific serine protease activity was a more potent tumor suppressor. Tumor rejection was not due to adaptive immune responses because RAG1-/- mice challenged with melanoma cells expressing either FAP or FSM were not tumorigenic. In in vitro assays, FAP or FSM expression restored contact inhibition, led to cell cycle arrest at G0/G1 phase, and increased susceptibility to stress-induced apoptosis. Cell death in FAP+ or FSM+ melanoma cells was readily triggered by depletion of survival factors from the media, leading to subsequent activation of caspases via the intrinsic pathway. These results show that expression of FAP is a tumor suppressor that abrogates tumorigenicity through regulation of cell growth and survival.},

   abstract = {It has recently been reported that dipeptidyl aminopeptidase X (DPPX) interacts with the voltage-gated potassium channel Kv4 and that co-expression of DPPX together with Kv4 pore forming alpha-subunits, and potassium channel interacting proteins (KChIPs), reconstitutes properties of native A-type potassium channels in vitro. Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of the extracellular domain of human DPPX determined at 3.0A resolution. This structure reveals the potential for a surface electrostatic change based on the protonation state of histidine. Subtle changes in extracellular pH might modulate the interaction of DPPX with Kv4.2 and possibly with other proteins. We propose models of DPPX interaction with the voltage-gated potassium channel complex. The dimeric structure of DPPX is highly homologous to the related protein DPP-IV. Comparison of the active sites of DPPX and DPP-IV reveals loss of the catalytic serine residue but the presence of an additional serine near the "active" site. However, the arrangement of residues is inconsistent with that of canonical serine proteases and DPPX is unlikely to function as a protease (dipeptidyl aminopeptidase).},

   abstract = {A new method of desorption ionization is described and applied to the ionization of various compounds, including peptides and proteins present on metal, polymer, and mineral surfaces. Desorption electrospray ionization (DESI) is carried out by directing electrosprayed charged droplets and ions of solvent onto the surface to be analyzed. The impact of the charged particles on the surface produces gaseous ions of material originally present on the surface. The resulting mass spectra are similar to normal ESI mass spectra in that they show mainly singly or multiply charged molecular ions of the analytes. The DESI phenomenon was observed both in the case of conductive and insulator surfaces and for compounds ranging from nonpolar small molecules such as lycopene, the alkaloid coniceine, and small drugs, through polar compounds such as peptides and proteins. Changes in the solution that is sprayed can be used to selectively ionize particular compounds, including those in biological matrices. In vivo analysis is demonstrated.%U http://science.sciencemag.org/content/sci/306/5695/471.full.pdf},

   abstract = {Opioid receptors belong to the large superfamily of seven transmembrane-spanning (7TM) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). As a class, GPCRs are of fundamental physiological importance mediating the actions of the majority of known neurotransmitters and hormones. Opioid receptors are particularly intriguing members of this receptor family. They are activated both by endogenously produced opioid peptides and by exogenously administered opiate compounds, some of which are not only among the most effective analgesics known but also highly addictive drugs of abuse. A fundamental question in addiction biology is why exogenous opioid drugs, such as morphine and heroin, have a high liability for inducing tolerance, dependence, and addiction. This review focuses on many aspects of opioid receptors with the aim of gaining a greater insight into mechanisms of opioid tolerance and dependence.},

   abstract = {Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. Lung cancers produce a variety of mitogenic growth factors that stimulate tumor cell proliferation and migration. The cell surface protease, dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV), is involved in diverse biologic functions, including peptide-mediated cellular growth and differentiation. DPPIV is expressed in various normal tissues, including lung tissue, and its expression is lost in many types of human cancers. DPPIV expression and its enzymatic activity are detected in normal bronchial and alveolar epithelium but different histologic subtypes of lung carcinomas lose DPPIV expression. To investigate the role of DPPIV in lung carcinoma, we examined the expression of DPPIV at both mRNA and protein levels in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell lines and normal human bronchial epithelial cells. DPPIV expression was detectable in normal lung epithelial cells, but was absent or markedly reduced in all NSCLC cell lines at both mRNA and protein levels. Restoration of DPPIV expression in NSCLC cells resulted in profound morphologic changes, inhibition of cell proliferation, anchorage-independent growth, in vitro cell migration and tumorigenicity in nude mice. DPPIV reexpression also correlated with increased p21 expression, leading to induction of apoptosis and cell cycle arrest in G1 stage. These effects were accompanied by increased expression of cell surface proteins, fibroblast-activating protein (Fapalpha) and CD44 that are associated with suppression of tumor growth and metastasis. Thus, DPPIV functions as a tumor suppressor, and its downregulation may contribute to the loss of growth control in NSCLC cells.},

   abstract = {The Protein Information Resource (PIR) is an integrated public resource of protein informatics. To facilitate the sensible propagation and standardization of protein annotation and the systematic detection of annotation errors, PIR has extended its superfamily concept and developed the SuperFamily (PIRSF) classification system. Based on the evolutionary relationships of whole proteins, this classification system allows annotation of both specific biological and generic biochemical functions. The system adopts a network structure for protein classification from superfamily to subfamily levels. Protein family members are homologous (sharing common ancestry) and homeomorphic (sharing full‐length sequence similarity with common domain architecture). The PIRSF database consists of two data sets, preliminary clusters and curated families. The curated families include family name, protein membership, parent–child relationship, domain architecture, and optional description and bibliography. PIRSF is accessible from the website at http://pir.georgetown.edu/pirsf/ for report retrieval and sequence classification. The report presents family annotation, membership statistics, cross‐references to other databases, graphical display of domain architecture, and links to multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic trees for curated families. PIRSF can be utilized to analyze phylogenetic profiles, to reveal functional convergence and divergence, and to identify interesting relationships between homeomorphic families, domains and structural classes.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAPalpha) is highly expressed in epithelial cancers and has been implicated in extracellular matrix remodeling, tumor growth, and metastasis. We present the first high resolution structure for the apoenzyme as well as kinetic data toward small dipeptide substrates. FAPalpha exhibits a dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV)-like fold, featuring an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain and an eight-bladed beta-propeller domain. Known DPPIV dipeptides are cleaved by FAPalpha with an approximately 100-fold decrease in catalytic efficiency compared with DPPIV. Moreover, FAPalpha, but not DPPIV, possesses endopeptidase activity toward N-terminal benzyloxycarbonyl (Z)-blocked peptides. Comparison of the crystal structures of FAPalpha and DPPIV revealed one major difference in the vicinity of the Glu motif (Glu(203)-Glu(204) for FAPalpha; Glu(205)-Glu(206) for DPPIV) within the active site of the enzyme. Ala(657) in FAPalpha, instead of Asp(663) as in DP-PIV, reduces the acidity in this pocket, and this change could explain the lower affinity for N-terminal amines by FAPalpha. This hypothesis was tested by kinetic analysis of the mutant FAPalpha/A657D, which shows on average an approximately 60-fold increase in the catalytic efficiency, as measured by k(cat)/K(m), for the cleavage of dipeptide substrates. Furthermore, the catalytic efficiency of the mutant is reduced by approximately 350-fold for cleavage of Z-Gly-Pro-7-amino-4-methylcoumarin. Our data provide a clear understanding of the molecular determinants responsible for the substrate specificity and endopeptidase activity of FAPalpha.},

   abstract = {Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is currently being explored as a new approach to the treatment of type 2 diabetes. This concept has emerged from the powerful and rapid action of the enzyme to inactivate glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). However, other bioactive peptides with potential influence of islet function are also substrates of DPP-4. Whether this inactivation may add to the beneficial effects of DPP-4 inhibition is not known. In this study, we explored whether DPP-4 inhibition by valine-pyrrolidide (val-pyr; 100 micromol/kg administered through gastric gavage at t = -30 min) affects the insulin and glucose responses to iv glucose (1 g/kg) together with GLP-1 (10 nmol/kg), glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP; 10 nmol/kg), pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide 38 (PACAP38; 1.3 nmol/kg), or gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP; 20 nmol/kg) given at t = 0 in anesthetized C57BL/6J mice. It was found that the acute (1-5 min) insulin response to GLP-1 was augmented by val-pyr by 80% (4.2 +/- 0.4 vs. 7.6 +/- 0.8 nmol/liter), that to GIP by 40% (2.7 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.8 +/- 0.4 nmol/liter), that to PACAP38 by 75% (4.6 +/- 0.5 vs. 8.1 +/- 0.6 nmol/liter), and that to GRP by 25% (1.8 +/- 0.2 vs. 2.3 +/- 0.3 nmol/liter; all P < 0.05 or less). This was associated with enhanced glucose elimination rate after GLP-1 [glucose elimination constant (K(G)) 2.1 +/- 0.2 vs. 3.1 +/- 0.3%/min] and PACAP38 (2.1 +/- 0.3 vs. 3.2 +/- 0.3%/min; both P < 0.01), but not after GIP or GRP. The augmented insulin response to GRP by val-pyr was prevented by the GLP-1 receptor antagonist, exendin(3) (9-39), raising the possibility that GRP effects may occur secondary to stimulation of GLP-1 secretion. We conclude that DPP-4 inhibition augments the insulin response not only to GLP-1 but also to GIP, PACAP38, and GRP.},

It is found that Cα−C bond cleavage is favored over side-chain loss, although loss of a tyrosine side chain may compete with Cα−C cleavage because the tyrosine radical formed can delocalize its unpaired electron over its aromatic ring. In addition, it is found that fragmentation of the nitrogen-centered radicals formed in EDD results in cleavage to produce so-called a•/x fragments rather than a/x• fragments both because producing the former involves a significantly smaller barrier and is nearly thermoneutral, while cleavage to yield a/x• is significantly endothermic.},

   abstract = {Helicobacter pylori is one of the most common bacterial pathogens and causes a variety of diseases, such as peptic ulcer or gastric cancer. Despite intensive study of this human pathogen in the last decades, knowledge about its membrane proteins and, in particular, those which are putative components of the type IV secretion system encoded by the cag pathogenicity island (PAI) remains limited. Our aim is to establish a dynamic two-dimensional electrophoresis-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2-DE-PAGE) database with multiple subproteomes of H. pylori (http://www.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de/2D-PAGE) which facilitates identification of bacterial proteins important in pathogen-host interactions. Using a proteomic approach, we investigated the protein composition of two H. pylori fractions: soluble proteins and structure-bound proteins (including membrane proteins). Both fractions differed markedly in the overall protein composition as determined by 2-DE. The 50 most abundant protein spots in each fraction were identified by peptide mass fingerprinting. We detected four cag PAI proteins, numerous outer membrane proteins (OMPs), the vacuolating cytotoxin VacA, other potential virulence factors, and few ribosomal proteins in the structure-bound fraction. In contrast, catalase (KatA), γ-glutamyltranspeptidase (Ggt), and the neutrophil-activating protein NapA were found almost exclusively in the soluble protein fraction. The results presented here are an important complement to genome sequence data, and the established 2-D PAGE maps provide a basis for comparative studies of the H. pylori proteome. Such subproteomes in the public domain will be effective instruments for identifying new virulence factors and antigens of potential diagnostic and/or curative value against infections with this important pathogen.},

PoPS specificity models can be used to predict and rank likely cleavages within a single substrate, and within entire proteomes. Other factors, such as the secondary or tertiary structure of the substrate, can be used to screen unlikely sites. Furthermore, the tool also provides facilities to infer, compare and test models, and to store them in a publicly accessible database.},

Characterization of these proteases requires not only an understanding of substrate specificity, but also the identification of specific protein substrates. Recent advances in proteomics technology have introduced new techniques for the study of protease function. Here, we highlight a proteomic approach used in our laboratory that employs two-dimensional gel electrophoresis coupled with mass spectrometry to identify native protease substrates. With this technique, we have successfully detected both known and novel granzyme B substrates, characterized cleavage products, and identified a granzyme B cleavage site. This approach may serve as an important discovery tool for other immunologic proteases.},

   abstract = {Catestatin (bCGA(344-364)), an endogenous peptide of bovine chromogranin A, was initially characterized for its effect on the inhibition of catecholamine release from chromaffin cells. Catestatin and its active domain (bCGA(344-358)) were identified in chromaffin cells and in secretion medium. The present study identified a potent antimicrobial activity of bCGA(344-358) in the lowmicromolar range against bacteria, fungi and yeasts, without showing any haemolytic activity. Confocal laser microscopy demonstrated penetration of the rhodaminated peptide into the cell membranes of fungi and yeasts and its intracellular accumulation. Time-lapse videomicroscopy showed arrest of fungal growth upon penetration of the labelled peptide into a fungal filament. We identified several catestatin-containing fragments in the stimulated secretion medium of human polymorphonuclear neutrophils, suggesting the N-terminal sequence of catestatin (bCGA(344-358)) (named cateslytin) as a novel component of innate immunity.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV, CD26), a protease-cleaving N-terminal X-Pro dipeptide from selected proteins including some chemokines, is expressed both as a soluble form in plasma and on the cell surface of various immune and nonimmune cell types. To gain insights into the pathophysiological role of CD26 in arthritis, we explored DPPIV/CD26 expression during murine antigen-induced arthritis (AIA), an experimental model of arthritis. AIA induction led to reduced plasma DPPIV activity. In CD26-deficient mice, the severity of AIA was increased as assessed by enhanced technetium uptake and by increased histological parameters of inflammation (synovial thickness and exudate). We demonstrated that CD26 controls the in vivo half-life of the intact active form of the proinflammatory chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). CD26-deficient mice exhibited increased levels of circulating active SDF-1, associated with increased numbers of SDF-1 receptor (CXCR4)-positive cells infiltrating arthritic joints. In a clinical study, plasma levels of DPPIV/CD26 from rheumatoid arthritis patients were significantly decreased when compared to those from osteoarthritis patients and inversely correlate with C-reactive protein levels. In conclusion, decreased circulating CD26 levels in arthritis may influence CD26-mediated regulation of the chemotactic SDF-1/CXCR4 axis.},

   abstract = {In this study, differential protein expression was assessed during human atherosclerotic plaque progression. A multifaceted approach was used in which differential protein expression was studied by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and validated in individual patients using western blotting and immunohistochemistry. 2D profiles of whole-mount advanced stable lesions were compared to those of plaques containing a thrombus. Mass spectrometry analysis identified vinexin-β and α1-antitrypsin (AAT) in the same spot that was differentially expressed in plaques with a thrombus. Immunohistochemistry and western blotting showed limited expression of both vinexin-β and AAT in early lesions, whereas high expression of both proteins was found in advanced lesions. Differential expression of vinexin-β in lesions with a thrombus compared to stable plaques could not be confirmed, indicating the importance of validation of proteomic analysis. For AAT, western blotting of 2D gels revealed expression of six isoforms in advanced plaques, one of which was confirmed to be solely expressed in thrombus-containing plaques. In conclusion, vinexin-β is expressed in advanced human atherosclerotic plaques, but differential expression of this protein in lesions with a thrombus versus stable plaques could not be confirmed. However, this analysis revealed expression of six isoforms of AAT in advanced plaques, one of which was uniquely expressed in thrombus-containing plaques.

The database was designed to administer complete in silico proteomes and links them with experimental proteomic data in the manner of 2D electrophoresis gels (IPG-Dalt). The 2D gels serve as reference maps in 2D gel analysis as well as tools for navigation of the database to switch between experimental and predicted data. Therefore, all identified spots in the gels are clickable and linked with summarized protein information. The protein information tables contain calculated characteristics, which are often used in proteomics, such as the molecular weight, isoelectric point, codon adaptation index, grand average of hydropathicity, etc. The design of the database permits online extension of gel data and protein attributes without knowledge of any software language. Besides navigation via 2D gels, the clear graphical user interface permits quick and intuitive searching throughout complete proteomes and supports, e.g. the search for proteins with isoelectric points within pH ranges of interest or protein classes (e.g. ribosomal proteins or transporters). The first organism implemented in the database is Lactococcus lactis. The database is available at www.wzw.tum.de/proteomik/lactis.},

   abstract = {Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a potent intestinotrophic growth factor that enhances repair of damaged intestinal tissue. However, its bioactivity is limited by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV)-mediated degradation. We hypothesized that DPIV(-/-) mice would display an increased resistance to, and an enhanced recovery from, dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced colitis compared to DPIV(+/+) mice. DPIV(+/+) and DPIV(-/-) mice consumed 2% DSS for 6 days, followed by a 15 day recovery period. Mice were killed at days 0, 3, 6, 9, 14, and 21 (n = 6-8) and the small intestine and colon removed for histological assessment of villus height, crypt depth, and crypt area. The epithelial cell proliferative labeling index was determined by proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining. Small intestine, colon, and total body weight did not differ between DPIV(+/+) and DPIV(-/-) mice. Distal colon crypt depth did not differ significantly between DPIV(+/+) and DPIV(-/-) mice during the development of DSS-colitis or during the recovery phase. Similarly no significant effects were apparent on distal colon crypt area or PCNA labeling index between DPIV(+/+) and DPIV(-/-) during the development of and recovery from DSS-colitis. However, DPIV(-/-) mice still possessed significant levels of plasma DPIV-like activity. We conclude that loss of DPIV activity does not increase resistance to experimental colitis and hypothesize that other DPIV family members may also be involved in the cleavage of GLP-2.},

   abstract = {DP (dipeptidyl peptidase) IV is the archetypal member of its six-member gene family. Four members of this family, DPIV, FAP (fibroblast activation protein), DP8 and DP9, have a rare substrate specificity, hydrolysis of a prolyl bond two residues from the N-terminus. The ubiquitous DPIV glycoprotein has proved interesting in the fields of immunology, endocrinology, haematology and endothelial cell and cancer biology and DPIV has become a novel target for Type II diabetes therapy. The crystal structure shows that the soluble form of DPIV comprises two domains, an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain and an eight-blade beta-propeller domain. The propeller domain contains the ADA (adenosine deaminase) binding site, a dimerization site, antibody epitopes and two openings for substrate access to the internal active site. FAP is structurally very similar to DPIV, but FAP protein expression is largely confined to diseased and damaged tissue, notably the tissue remodelling interface in chronically injured liver. DPIV has a variety of peptide substrates, the best studied being GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1), NPY (neuropeptide Y) and CXCL12. The DPIV family has roles in bone marrow mobilization. The functional interactions of DPIV and FAP with extracellular matrix confer roles for these proteins in cancer biology. DP8 and DP9 are widely distributed and indirectly implicated in immune function. The DPL (DP-like) glycoproteins that lack peptidase activity, DPL1 and DPL2, are brain-expressed potassium channel modulators. Thus the six members of the DPIV gene family exhibit diverse biological roles.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP-alpha) and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) are serine proteases with post-prolyl peptidase activities that can modify tumor cell behavior. FAP-alpha and DPPIV can form heteromeric complexes with each other and may function coordinately to modulate the growth, differentiation, adhesion, and metastasis of tumor cells. This review is focused on FAP-alpha and summarizes a series of studies showing that elevated expression of FAP-alpha results in profound changes in growth and malignant behavior of tumor cells. Depending on the model system investigated, FAP-alpha expression causes dramatic promotion or suppression of tumor growth. In the case of tumor promotion, FAP-alpha expression can drive tumor growth by increasing angiogenesis and by decreasing the anti-tumor response of the immune system. In the case of tumor suppression, FAP-alpha can decrease tumorigenicity of mouse melanoma cells and restore contact inhibition and growth factor dependence even when it is catalytically inactive, implying that protein-protein interactions mediate these effects. Understanding how FAP-alpha activates cell signaling is critical to determining how FAP-alpha mediates growth promotion versus growth suppression in the different model systems and ultimately in human cancer patients. In particular, the roles of FAP-alpha protease activity and FAP-alpha complex formation with DPPIV and other surface molecules in activating cell signaling need to be elucidated since these represent potential targets for therapeutic intervention.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) is a 110-kDa glycoprotein with ubiquitous expression. Several recent studies have shown that DPPIV affects tumor progression in several human malignancies. We found that ovarian carcinoma cell lines with higher DPPIV expression showed less invasive potential. Furthermore, introduction of DPPIV cDNA into SKOV3 cells (SKDPIV), derived from serous cystadenocarcinoma showing little DPPIV expression, caused a significant decrease in both migration and invasive potential. In addition, nude mice inoculated with SKDPIV cells showed significantly less peritoneal dissemination and longer survival time than those inoculated with parental or vector-transfected cells. We further examined the mechanisms of anti-invasive ability of DPPIV. The expression of E-cadherin was positively correlated with DPPIV expression among five independent ovarian carcinoma cell lines. The SKDPIV cells showed enhanced expression of E-cadherin with a cellular morphological change from a fibroblastic and motile phenotype to an epithelial phenotype compared to parental and MOCK cells. In addition, matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2) and membrane type 1 matrix metalloprotease (MT1-MMP), which are important markers associated with invasive and metastatic potential, were remarkably reduced in SKDPIV cells. In contrast, tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) were enhanced by DPPIV transfection. These findings imply that DPPIV may functionally suppress peritoneal dissemination and progression of ovarian carcinoma by regulating the expression levels of several molecules associated with carcinoma cell invasion and progression.},

   abstract = {Fragmentation of peptide polyanions by electron detachment dissociation (EDD) has been induced by electron irradiation of deprotonated polypeptides [M−nH]n− with >10 eV electrons. EDD has been found to lead preferentially to a. and x fragment ions (CαC backbone cleavage) arising from the dissociation of oxidized radical anions [M−nH](n−1)−.. We demonstrate that CαC cleavages, which are otherwise rarely observed in tandem mass spectrometry, can account for most of the backbone fragmentation, with even-electron x fragments dominating over radical a. ions. Ab initio calculations at the B3 LYP level of theory with the 6-311+G(2 p,2 d)//6-31+G(d,p) basis set suggested a unidirectional mechanism for EDD (cleavage always N-terminal to the radical site), with a., x formation being favored over a, x. fragmentation by 74.2 kJ mol−1. Thus, backbone CαC bonds N-terminal to proline residues should be immune to EDD, in agreement with the observations. EDD may find application in mass spectrometry for such tasks as peptide sequencing and localization of labile post-translational modifications, for example, those introduced by sulfation and phosphorylation. EDD can now be performed not only in Fourier transform mass spectrometry, but also in far more widely used quadrupole (Paul) ion traps.},

Therefore microdissecting tissue material is mandatory prior to sample lysis and all downstream applications of protein analysis (proteomics). The two most important dissecting methods for bladder tissue specimens are manual microdissection and laser microdissection. Sample transfer can further be separated into manual laser pressure catapulting (LPC) and laser capture microdissection (LCM). One of the possible downstream applications of protein analysis is surface-enhanced laser desorption ionization (SELDI) time-of-flight mass spectrometry.

   abstract = {Gangliosides play important biological roles and structural characterization of both the carbohydrate and the lipid moieties is important. The FT-ICR MS/MS techniques of electron capture dissociation (ECD), electron detachment dissociation (EDD), and infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) provide extensive fragmentation of the protonated and deprotonated GM1 ganglioside. ECD provides extensive structural information, including identification of both halves of the ceramide and cleavage of the acetyl moiety of the N-acetylated sugars. IRMPD provides similar glycan fragmentation but no cleavage of the acetyl moiety. Cleavage between the fatty acid and the long-chain base of the ceramide moiety is seen in negative-ion IRMPD but not in positive-ion IRMPD of GM1. Furthermore, this extent of fragmentation requires a range of laser powers, whereas all information is available from a single ECD experiment. However, stepwise fragmentation by IRMPD may be used to map the relative labilities for a series of cleavages. EDD provides the alternative of electron-induced fragmentation for negative ions with extensive fragmentation, but suffers from low efficiency as well as complication of data analysis by frequent loss of hydrogen atoms. We also show that analysis of MS/MS data for glycolipids is greatly simplified by classification of product ion masses to specific regions of the ganglioside based solely on mass defect graphical analysis.},

   abstract = {Post-translational proteolytic processing of the preproglucagon gene in the gut results in the formation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1). Owing to its glucose-dependent insulinotropic effect, this hormone was postulated to primarily act as an incretin, i.e. to augment insulin secretion after oral glucose or meal ingestion. In addition, GLP-1 decelerates gastric emptying and suppresses glucagon secretion. Under physiological conditions, GLP-1 acts as a part of the ‘ileal brake’, meaning that is slows the transition of nutrients into the distal gut. Animal studies suggest a role for GLP-1 in the development and growth of the endocrine pancreas. In light of its multiple actions throughout the body, different therapeutic applications of GLP-1 are possible. Promising results have been obtained with GLP-1 in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, but its potential to reduce appetite and food intake may also allow its use for the treatment of obesity. While rapid in vivo degradation of GLP-1 has yet prevented its broad clinical use, different pharmacological approaches aiming to extend the in vivo half-life of GLP-1 or to inhibit its inactivation are currently being evaluated. Therefore, antidiabetic treatment based on GLP-1 may become available within the next years. This review will summarize the biological effects of GLP-1, characterize its role in human biology and pathology, and discuss potential clinical applications as well as current clinical studies.

   abstract = {CD26 is a T-cell costimulatory molecule with dipeptidyl peptidase IV enzyme activity in its extracellular region. We have previously reported that the addition of recombinant soluble CD26 resulted in enhanced proliferation of human T lymphocytes induced by the recall antigen tetanus toxoid (TT) via upregulation of CD86 on monocytes and that caveolin-1 was a binding protein of CD26, and the CD26-caveolin-1 interaction resulted in caveolin-1 phosphorylation (p-cav-1) as well as TT-mediated T-cell proliferation. However, the mechanism involved in this immune enhancement has not yet been elucidated. In the present work, we perform experiments to identify the molecular mechanisms by which p-cav-1 leads directly to the upregulation of CD86. Through proteomic analysis, we identify Tollip (Toll-interacting protein) and IRAK-1 (interleukin-1 receptor-associated serine/threonine kinase 1) as caveolin-1-interacting proteins in monocytes. We also demonstrate that following stimulation by exogenous CD26, Tollip and IRAK-1 dissociate from caveolin-1, and IRAK-1 is then phosphorylated in the cytosol, leading to the upregulation of CD86 via activation of NF-kappaB. Binding of CD26 to caveolin-1 therefore regulates signaling pathways in antigen-presenting cells to induce antigen-specific T-cell proliferation.},

   abstract = {Adenosine deaminase (ADA), a protein whose deficit leads to severe combined immunodeficiency, binds to the cell surface by means of either CD26, A(1) adenosine receptors, or A(2B) adenosine receptors. The physiological role of these interactions is not well understood. Our results show that by a 3-fold reduction in the EC(50) for the antigen, ADA potentiated T cell proliferation in autologous cocultures with antigen-pulsed immature or mature dendritic cells. Costimulation was not due to the enzymatic activity but to the interaction of ADA-CD26 complexes in T cells with an ADA-anchoring protein in dendritic cells. From colocalization studies, it is deduced that ADA colocalizing with adenosine receptors on dendritic cells interact with CD26 expressed on lymphocytes. This costimulatory signal in the immunological synapse leads to a marked increase (3- to 34-fold) in the production of the T helper 1 and proimmflamatory cytokines IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha, and IL-6.},

   volume = {6},

   note = {Validation Studies},
   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Protein subcellular localization is an important determinant of protein function and hence, reliable methods for prediction of localization are needed. A number of prediction algorithms have been developed based on amino acid compositions or on the N-terminal characteristics (signal peptides) of proteins. However, such approaches lead to a loss of contextual information. Moreover, where information about the physicochemical properties of amino acids has been used, the methods employed to exploit that information are less than optimal and could use the information more effectively. RESULTS: In this paper, we propose a new algorithm called pSLIP which uses Support Vector Machines (SVMs) in conjunction with multiple physicochemical properties of amino acids to predict protein subcellular localization in eukaryotes across six different locations, namely, chloroplast, cytoplasmic, extracellular, mitochondrial, nuclear and plasma membrane. The algorithm was applied to the dataset provided by Park and Kanehisa and we obtained prediction accuracies for the different classes ranging from 87.7%-97.0% with an overall accuracy of 93.1%. CONCLUSION: This study presents a physicochemical property based protein localization prediction algorithm. Unlike other algorithms, contextual information is preserved by dividing the protein sequences into clusters. The prediction accuracy shows an improvement over other algorithms based on various types of amino acid composition (single, pair and gapped pair). We have also implemented a web server to predict protein localization across the six classes (available at http://pslip.bii.a-star.edu.sg/).},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND:Structural and functional research often requires the computation of sets of protein structures based on certain properties of the proteins, such as sequence features, fold classification, or functional annotation. Compiling such sets using current web resources is tedious because the necessary data are spread over many different databases. To facilitate this task, we have created COLUMBA, an integrated database of annotations of protein structures.DESCRIPTION:COLUMBA currently integrates twelve different databases, including PDB, KEGG, Swiss-Prot, CATH, SCOP, the Gene Ontology, and ENZYME. The database can be searched using either keyword search or data source-specific web forms. Users can thus quickly select and download PDB entries that, for instance, participate in a particular pathway, are classified as containing a certain CATH architecture, are annotated as having a certain molecular function in the Gene Ontology, and whose structures have a resolution under a defined threshold. The results of queries are provided in both machine-readable extensible markup language and human-readable format. The structures themselves can be viewed interactively on the web.CONCLUSION:The COLUMBA database facilitates the creation of protein structure data sets for many structure-based studies. It allows to combine queries on a number of structure-related databases not covered by other projects at present. Thus, information on both many and few protein structures can be used efficiently. The web interface for COLUMBA is available at http://www.columba-db.de.},

   abstract = {Injury and repair in chronic liver disease involve cell adhesion, migration, apoptosis, proliferation, and a wound healing response. In liver, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) has both collagenase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) activities and is expressed only by activated hepatic stellate cells (HSC) and myofibroblasts, which produce and degrade extracellular matrix (ECM). FAP was colocalized with collagen fibers, fibronectin, and collagen type I in human liver. FAP function was examined in vitro by expressing green fluorescent protein FAP fusion protein in cell lines cultured on collagen-I, fibronectin, and Matrigel. Glutamates at 203 and 204 as well as serine624 of FAP were essential for peptidase activity. Human embryonic kidney 293T cells overexpressing FAP showed reduced adhesion and migration. FAP overexpression in the human HSC line LX-2 caused increased cell adhesion and migration on ECM proteins as well as invasion across transwells in the absence or presence of transforming growth factor beta-1. FAP overexpression enhanced staurosporine streptomyces-stimulated apoptosis in both cell lines. Interestingly, the enzyme activity of FAP was not required for these functions. Overexpressing FAP increased the expression of matrix metalloproteinase-2 and CD44 and reduced integrin-beta1 expression in 293T cells, suggesting potential pathways of FAP-mediated impairment of cell adhesion and migration in this epithelial cell line. In conclusion, these findings further support a pro-fibrogenic role for FAP by indicating that, in addition to its enzymatic functions, FAP has important nonenzymatic functions that in chronic liver injury may facilitate tissue remodeling through FAP-mediated enhancement of HSC cell adhesion, migration, and apoptosis.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein (FAP), as described so far, is a type II cell surface serine protease expressed by fibroblastic cells in areas of active tissue remodelling such as tumour stroma or healing wounds. We investigated the expression of FAP by fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLSs) and compared the synovial expression pattern in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) and osteoarthritis (OA) patients. Synovial tissue from diseased joints of 20 patients, 10 patients with refractory RA and 10 patients with end-stage OA, was collected during routine surgery. As a result, FLSs from intensively inflamed synovial tissues of refractory RA expressed FAP at high density. Moreover, FAP expression was co-localised with matrix metalloproteinases (MMP-1 and MMP-13) and CD44 splice variants v3 and v7/8 known to play a major role in the concert of extracellular matrix degradation. The pattern of signals appeared to constitute a characteristic feature of FLSs involved in rheumatoid arthritic joint-destructive processes. These FAP-expressing FLSs with a phenotype of smooth muscle actin-positive myofibroblasts were located in the lining layer of the synovium and differ distinctly from Thy-1-expressing and non-proliferating fibroblasts of the articular matrix. The intensity of FAP-specific staining in synovial tissue from patients with RA was found to be different when compared with end-stage OA. Because expression of FAP by RA FLSs has not been described before, the findings of this study highlight a novel element in cartilage and bone destruction of arthritic joints. Moreover, the specific expression pattern qualifies FAP as a therapeutic target for inhibiting the destructive potential of fibroblast-like synovial cells.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors represent a new class of oral antihyperglycemic agents. Sitagliptin is an orally active and selective DPP-IV inhibitor currently in Phase III development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) properties and tolerability of multiple oral once-daily or twice-daily doses of sitagliptin. METHODS: This double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled,incremental oral-dose study was conducted at SGS Biopharma, Antwerp, Belgium. Healthy, nonsmoking male volunteers aged 18 to 45 years with a creatinine clearance rate of >80 mL/min and normoglycemia and weighing within 15% of their ideal height/weight range were randomly assigned to 1 of 8 treatment groups: sitagliptin 25, 50, 100, 200, or 400 mg or placebo, QD for 10 days; a single dose of sitagliptin 800 mg administered on day 1 followed by 600 mg QD on days 3 to 10; or sitagliptin 300 mg BID for 10 days. For analysis of PK properties, plasma and urine samples were obtained before study drug administration on day 1 and at 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, and 16 hours after study drug administration on day 1; before study drug administration on days 2 to 9; and every 24 hours for 96 hours after the last dose on day 10, and analyzed for sitagliptin concentrations. Assays were used to measure inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity and plasma concentrations of active and total glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1), glucose, and glucagon, and serum concentrations of insulin, C-peptide, insulin-like growth factor-1, and insulin like growth factor binding protein-3. Tolerability was assessed throughout the study using physical examination, including vital sign measurements; 12-lead electrocardiography; and laboratory analysis, including hematology, biochemistry (hepatic aminotransferase and creatine phosphokinase), and urinalysis. RESULTS: Seventy subjects were enrolled (mean age, 32.9 years [range, 18-45 years]; mean weight, 79.7 kg [range, 63.4-97.7 kg]; 8 patients per sitagliptin study group and 14 patients in the control group). In the sitagliptin groups, the plasma concentration-time profiles and principal PK parameters (T(max), C(max), and t((1/2))) were statistically similar at days 1 (single dose) and 10 (steady state). In the groups receiving sitagliptin QD doses, accumulation of sitagliptin was modest (AUC accumulation ratio [day 10/day 1] range, 1.05-1.29), and the apparent terminal elimination t((1/2)) was 11.8 to 14.4 hours. At steady state in the sitagliptin QD groups, the mean proportion of drug excreted unchanged in the urine was approximately 70.6%. Dose-dependent inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity was apparent, and the pattern of inhibition at steady state (day 10) was statistically similar to that observed on day 1. Day-10 weighted mean inhibition of plasma DPP-IV activity over 24 hours was > or = 80% for doses of > or = 50 mg QD. After a standard meal, active GLP-1 concentrations were significantly increased in the sitagliptin groups by approximately 2-fold compared with that in the control group, a finding consistent with near-maximal acute glucose lowering in preclinical studies. Across doses, no apparent adverse effects, including hypoglycemia, were found or reported. CONCLUSIONS: The results from this study in a select population of healthy male volunteers suggest that multiple oral doses of sitagliptin inhibited plasma DPP-IV activity and affected active GLP-1 concentrations in a dose-dependent manner, without producing hypoglycemia. Multiple dosing of sitagliptin exhibited a PK/PD profile consistent with that of a QD regimen and was well tolerated.},

   abstract = {Biological entities are strongly related and mutually dependent on each other. Therefore, there is a growing need to corroborate and integrate data from different resources and aspects of biological systems in order to analyze them effectively. Biozon is a unified biological database that integrates heterogeneous data types such as proteins, structures, domain families, protein–protein interactions and cellular pathways, and establishes the relationships between them. All data are integrated on to a single graph schema centered around the non-redundant set of biological objects that are shared by each source. This integration results in a highly connected graph structure that provides a more complete picture of the known context of a given object that cannot be determined from any one source. Currently, Biozon integrates roughly 2 million protein sequences, 42 million DNA or RNA sequences, 32 000 protein structures, 150 000 interactions and more from sources such as GenBank, UniProt, Protein Data Bank (PDB) and BIND. Biozon augments source data with locally derived data such as 5 billion pairwise protein alignments and 8 million structural alignments. The user may form complex cross-type queries on the graph structure, add similarity relations to form fuzzy queries and rank the results based on analysis of the edge structure similar to Google PageRank, online at Biozon.org.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 have been identified as gene members of the S9b family of dipeptidyl peptidases. In the present paper, we report the characterization of recombinant dipeptidyl peptidases 8 and 9 using the baculovirus expression system. We have found that only the full-length variants of the two proteins can be expressed as active peptidases, which are 882 and 892 amino acids in length for dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and 9 respectively. We show further that the purified proteins are active dimers and that they show similar Michaelis-Menten kinetics and substrate specificity. Both cleave the peptide hormones glucagon-like peptide-1, glucagon-like peptide-2, neuropeptide Y and peptide YY with marked kinetic differences compared with dipeptidyl peptidase IV. Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidases IV, 8 and 9 using the well-known dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor valine pyrrolidide resulted in similar K(i) values, indicating that this inhibitor is non-selective for any of the three dipeptidyl peptidases.},

   abstract = {Biomedical research is increasingly a data-driven science. New technologies support the generation of genome-scale data sets of sequences, sequence variants, transcripts, and proteins; genetic elements underpinning understanding of biomedicine and disease. Information systems designed to manage these data, and the functional insights (biological knowledge) that come from the analysis of these data, are critical to mining large, heterogeneous data sets for new biologically relevant patterns, to generating hypotheses for experimental validation, and ultimately, to building models of how biological systems work. Bio-ontologies have an essential role in supporting two key approaches to effective interpretation of genome-scale data sets: data integration and comparative genomics. To date, bio-ontologies such as the Gene Ontology have been used primarily in community genome databases as structured controlled terminologies and as data aggregators. In this paper we use the Gene Ontology (GO) and the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) database as use cases to illustrate the impact of bio-ontologies on data integration and for comparative genomics. Despite the profound impact ontologies are having on the digital categorization of biological knowledge, new biomedical research and the expanding and changing nature of biological information have limited the development of bio-ontologies to support dynamic reasoning for knowledge discovery.},

After its beginnings as a technology advocated by computer scientists to overcome problems of heterogeneity, ontology has been taken up by biologists themselves as a means to consistently annotate features from genotype to phenotype. In medical informatics, artifacts called ontologies have been used for a longer period of time to produce controlled lexicons for coding schemes. In this article, we review the current position in ontologies and how they have become institutionalized within biomedicine. As the field has matured, the much older philosophical aspects of ontology have come into play. With this and the institutionalization of ontology has come greater formality. We review this trend and what benefits it might bring to ontologies and their use within biomedicine.},

   abstract = {The prolyl dipeptidase DPP-IV plays diverse and important roles in cellular functions. It is a membrane-bound exoprotease involved in the proteolytic cleavage of several insulin-sensing hormones. The inhibition of its enzymatic activity has been proven effective in the treatment of type II diabetes. Homodimeric DPP-IV interacts extracellularly with adenosine deaminase, and this interaction is critical for adenosine signaling and T-cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the contribution of hydrophobic interactions to the dimerization of DPP-IV. Hydrophobic residues F713, W734, and Y735 were found to be essential for DPP-IV dimerization. Moreover, the enzymatic activity of DPP-IV was correlated with its quaternary structure. Monomeric DPP-IV had only residual activity left, ranging from 1/30 to 1/1600 of the dimeric forms. Using a surface plasmon resonance technique, we demonstrated that the affinity of these DPP-IV monomers for adenosine deaminase was not significantly altered, compared to that of dimeric DPP-IV. The study not only identifies the hydrophobic interactions critical for DPP-IV dimer formation, but also reveals no global conformational change upon the formation of monomers as determined by the protein-protein interaction (Kd) of DPP-IV with adenosine deaminase.},

Such transitions can give rise to pathological conditions ranging from neurodegenerative disorders to systemic amyloidoses. In this review, we identify the diseases known to be associated with formation of fibrillar aggregates and the specific peptides and proteins involved in each case. We describe, in addition, that living organisms can take advantage of the inherent ability of proteins to form such structures to generate novel and diverse biological functions. We review recent advances toward the elucidation of the structures of amyloid fibrils and the mechanisms of their formation at a molecular level. Finally, we discuss the relative importance of the common main-chain and side-chain interactions in determining the propensities of proteins to aggregate and describe some of the evidence that the oligomeric fibril precursors are the primary origins of pathological behavior.},

At the molecular and cellular level multiple opioid receptors have been cloned and characterised, their potential for oligomerisation determined, a large family of endogenous opioid agonists has been discovered, multiple second messengers identified and our understanding of the adaptive changes to prolonged exposure to opioid drugs (tolerance and physical dependence) enhanced. In addition, we now have greater understanding of the processes by which opioids produce the euphoria that gives rise to the intense craving for these drugs in opioid addicts. In this article, we review the historical pathway of opioid research that has led to our current state of knowledge.

   abstract = {Glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide [GIP-(1-42)] is degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV), forming GIP-(3-42). In mice, high concentrations of synthetic GIP-(3-42) may function as a GIP receptor antagonist, but it is unclear whether this occurs at physiological concentrations. In COS-7 cells transiently transfected with the human GIP receptor, GIP-(1-42) and -(3-42) bind with affinities (IC(50)) of 5.2 and 22 nM, respectively. GIP-(1-42) was a potent agonist, stimulating cAMP accumulation (EC(50), 13.5 pM); GIP-(3-42) alone had no effect. When incubated together with native GIP, GIP-(3-42) behaved as a weak antagonist (IC(50), 92 and 731 nM for inhibition of cAMP accumulation elicited by 10 pM and 1 nM native GIP, respectively). In the isolated perfused rat pancreas, GIP-(3-42) alone had no effect on insulin output and only reduced the response to GIP (1 nM) when coinfused in >50-fold molar excess (IC(50), 138 nM). The ability of GIP-(3-42) to affect the antihyperglycemic or insulinotropic actions of GIP-(1-42) was examined in chloralose-anesthetized pigs given intravenous glucose. Endogenous DPP IV activity was inhibited to reduce degradation of the infused GIP-(1-42), which was infused alone and together with GIP-(3-42), at rates sufficient to mimic postprandial concentrations of each peptide. Glucose, insulin, and glucagon responses were identical irrespective of whether GIP-(1-42) was infused alone or together with GIP-(3-42). We conclude that, although GIP-(3-42) can weakly antagonize cAMP accumulation and insulin output in vitro, it does not behave as a physiological antagonist in vivo.},

A meaningful comparison of data across different experiments generated by different groups using different types of instruments is enabled by the implementation of a uniform analytic process. This uniform statistical validation ensures a consistent and high-quality set of peptide and protein identifications. The raw data from many diverse proteomic experiments are made available in the associated PeptideAtlas repository in several formats.

   abstract = {Sequence comparison is a major step in the prediction of protein structure
	from existing templates in the Protein Data Bank. The identification
	of potentially remote homologues to be used as templates for modeling
	target sequences of unknown structure and their accurate alignment
	remain challenges, despite many years of study. The most recent advances
	have been in combining as many sources of information as possible
	- including amino acid variation in the form of profiles or hidden
	Markov models for both the target and template families, known and
	predicted secondary structures of the template and target, respectively,
	the combination of structure alignment for distant homologues and
	sequence alignment for close homologues to build better profiles,
	and the anchoring of certain regions of the alignment based on existing
	biological data. Newer technologies have been applied to the problem,
	including the use of support vector machines to tackle the fold classification
	problem for a target sequence and the alignment of hidden Markov
	models. Finally, using the consensus of many fold recognition methods,
	whether based on profile-profile alignments, threading or other approaches,
	continues to be one of the most successful strategies for both recognition
	and alignment of remote homologues. Although there is still room
	for improvement in identification and alignment methods, additional
	progress may come from model building and refinement methods that
	can compensate for large structural changes between remotely related
	targets and templates, as well as for regions of misalignment. ¬©

To characterize FAP's P(4)-P(2)(') specificity, we synthesized intramolecularly quenched fluorescent substrate sets based on the FAP cleavage site in alpha(2)-antiplasmin (TSGP-NQ). FAP required substrates with Pro at P(1) and Gly or d-amino acids at P(2) and preferred small, uncharged amino acids at P(3), but tolerated most amino acids at P(4), P(1)(') and P(2)('). These substrate preferences allowed design of peptidyl-chloromethyl ketones that inhibited FAP, but not the related protease, dipeptidyl peptidase-4. Thus, FAP is a narrow specificity endopeptidase and this can be exploited for inhibitor design.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a transmembrane serine peptidase that belongs to the prolyl peptidase family. FAP has been implicated in cancer; however, its specific role remains elusive because inhibitors that distinguish FAP from other prolyl peptidases like dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) have not been developed. To identify peptide motifs for FAP-selective inhibitor design, we used P(2)-Pro(1) and acetyl (Ac)-P(2)-Pro(1) dipeptide substrate libraries, where P(2) was varied and substrate hydrolysis occurs between Pro(1) and a fluorescent leaving group. With the P(2)-Pro(1) library, FAP preferred Ile, Pro, or Arg at the P(2) residue; however, DPP-4 showed broad reactivity against this library, precluding selectivity. By contrast, with the Ac-P(2)-Pro(1) library, FAP cleaved only Ac-Gly-Pro, whereas DPP-4 showed little reactivity with all substrates. FAP also cleaved formyl-, benzyloxycarbonyl-, biotinyl-, and peptidyl-Gly-Pro substrates, which DPP-4 cleaved poorly, suggesting an N-acyl-Gly-Pro motif for inhibitor design. Therefore, we synthesized and tested the compound Ac-Gly-prolineboronic acid, which inhibited FAP with a K(i) of 23 +/- 3 nm. This was approximately 9- to approximately 5400-fold lower than the K(i) values for other prolyl peptidases, including DPP-4, DPP-7, DPP-8, DPP-9, prolyl oligopeptidase, and acylpeptide hydrolase. These results identify Ac-Gly-BoroPro as a FAP-selective inhibitor and suggest that N-acyl-Gly-Pro-based inhibitors will allow testing of FAP as a therapeutic target.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) is an alpha,beta-hydrolase-like serine exopeptidase, which removes dipeptides, preferentially with a C-terminal l-Pro residue, from the N terminus of longer peptide substrates. Previously, we determined the tetrameric 1.8A crystal structure of native porcine DPIV. Each monomer is composed of a beta-propeller and a catalytic domain, which together embrace an internal cavity housing the active centre. This cavity is connected to the bulk solvent by a "propeller opening" and a "side opening". Here, we analyse DPIV complexes with a t-butyl-Gly-Pro-Ile tripeptide, Pro-boroPro, a piperazine purine compound, and aminoethyl phenyl sulfonylfluoride. The latter two compounds bind to the active-site groove in a compact and a quite bulky manner, respectively, causing considerable shifts of the catalytic Ser630 side-chain and of the Tyr547 phenolic group, which forms the oxyanion hole. The tripeptide, mimicking a peptide substrate, is clamped to the active site through tight interactions via its N-terminal alpha-ammonium group, the P2 carbonyl group, the P1-l-Pro side-chain, the C-terminal carboxylate group, and the stable orthoacid ester amide formed between the scissile peptide carbonyl group and Ser630 O(gamma). This stable trapping of the tripeptide could be due to stabilization of the protonated His740 imidazolium cation by the adjacent negatively charged C-terminal carboxylate group, preventing proton transfer to the leaving group nitrogen atom. Docking experiments with the compact rigid 58 residue protein aprotinin, which had been shown to be processed by DPIV, indicate that the Arg1-Pro2 N terminus can access the DPIV active site only upon widening of its side openings, probably by separation of the first and the last propeller blades, and/or of the catalytic and the propeller domain.},

   abstract = {The enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV) inactivates a variety of bioactive peptides, including glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and growth hormone releasing hormone (GHRH). Inhibiting DPP-IV in order to increase circulating GLP-1 is of interest as a treatment for Type II diabetes. Inactivation of DPP-IV may also increase circulating GHRH, potentially enhancing growth in domestic animals. To test the hypothesis that inhibition of DPP-IV activity will influence the growth hormone/ IGF-1 axis, growing pigs (Sus scrofa domesticus, 78 kg) were treated with a DPP-IV inhibitor (Compound 1, the 2,5-difluor-ophenyl analog of the triazolopiperazine MK0431, sitagliptin), and plasma concentrations of IGF-1 were monitored. Pigs were administered either sterile saline (0.11 ml/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 2 ml/hr for 72 hrs, controls, n = 2), Compound 1 (2.78 mg/kg followed by a continuous infusion at 0.327 mg/kg x hr for 72 hrs, n = 4) or GHRH (0.11 ml/kg sterile saline, followed by a continuous infusion of GHRH at 2.5 microg/ kg x hr for 48 hrs, n = 4). Plasma concentrations of Compound 1 were maintained at 1 microM, which resulted in a 90% inhibition of circulating DPP-IV activity. Relative to the predose 24-hr period, area under the IGF-1 concentration curve (AUC) tended to be lower (P = 0.062) with Compound 1 (.79 +/- 130 ng/ml x hr) than controls (543 +/- 330 ng/ml x hr). GHRH treatment increased the IGF-1 AUC (1210 +/- 160 ng/ml x hr, P = 0.049 vs. controls and P = 0.001 vs. Compound 1). We conclude that inhibition of DPP-IV does not alter the circulating levels of IGF-1 in the growing pig.},

   abstract = {Purpose of review: The current review focuses on recent studies, both clinical and from basic sciences, which approach possible pathomechanisms of critical illness myopathy in order to better derive potential clinical strategies for a preventive or curative clinical setting. Trends and concepts of clinical diagnosis and handling will be evaluated and their implications for muscle physiology and nutritional/metabolic intervention discussed. Recent findings: Conventional electrophysiology was combined with direct muscle stimulation to better differentiate critical illness myopathy from other neuromuscular disorders in critical illness. Muscle weakness was the result of impaired excitation--contraction-coupling at the level of the sarcolemma and the sarcoplasmic reticulum membrane. Critical illness may alter sodium and ryanodine receptor calcium-release channels. Also, increased muscle proteolysis contributes to weakness in critical illness myopathy. Myosin loss is due to the risk factors systemic inflammatory response syndrome/sepsis, steroids and neuromuscular blocking agents. Steroids can also induce necrosis and apoptosis in muscle. Inflammatory mediators aggravated muscle metabolic failure in critical illness myopathy. Ubiquitin--proteasome pathways, cyclooxygenase activation, altered glucose transporter expression, MyoD suppression, impaired respiratory chain enzymes, ATP depletion, glucose toxicity and insulin resistance can all contribute to the critical illness myopathy pathomechanism. Summary: The search for pathomechanisms is an important task for both clinical and basic sciences. Targets for treatment or prevention of critical illness myopathy include systemic inflammatory response, increased proteolysis and reduced antioxidative capacitance in critically ill patients.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4/CD26) and seprase/fibroblast activation protein alpha are homologous type II transmembrane, homodimeric glycoproteins that exhibit unique prolyl peptidase activities. Human DPP4 is ubiquitously expressed in epithelial and endothelial cells and serves multiple functions in cleaving the penultimate positioned prolyl bonds at the NH(2) terminus of a variety of physiologically important peptides in the circulation. Recent studies showed a linkage between DPP4 and down-regulation of certain chemokines and mitogenic growth factors, and degradation of denatured collagens (gelatin), suggesting a role of DPP4 in the cell invasive phenotype. Here, we found the existence of a novel protease complex consisting of DPP4 and seprase in human endothelial cells that were activated to migrate and invade in the extracellular matrix in vitro. DPP4 and seprase were coexpressed with the three major protease systems (matrix metalloproteinase, plasminogen activator, and type II transmembrane serine protease) at the cell surface and organize as a complex at invadopodia-like protrusions. Both proteases were colocalized at the endothelial cells of capillaries, but not large blood vessels, in invasive breast ductal carcinoma in vivo. Importantly, monoclonal antibodies against the gelatin-binding domain of DPP4 blocked the local gelatin degradation by endothelial cells in the presence of the major metallo- and serine protease systems that modified pericellular collagenous matrices and subsequent cell migration and invasion. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism involving the DPP4 gelatin-binding domain of the DPP4-seprase complex that facilitates the local degradation of the extracellular matrix and the invasion of the endothelial cells into collagenous matrices.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: CD26 is a multifunctional cell surface glycoprotein expressed by T and B cells. It exhibits a dipeptidyl-peptidase activity (DPP-IV) that cleaves the penultimate proline from the N-terminus of polypeptides, thereby regulating their activity and concentration. METHODS: Using CD26-/- mice resulting from targeted inactivation of the gene, we examined the consequences of a DPP-IV defect on behavioural response to nociceptive stimuli and concentration of the pain modulator peptides substance P (SP) and endomorphin 2, two DPP-IV substrates. RESULTS: CD26 inactivation induced a three-fold decrease in circulating endopeptidase activity while that found in brain extracts was normal, albeit very weak. CD26-/- mice had high SP concentrations in plasma (3.4+/-1 pg/ml versus 1.5+/-0.3 pg/ml, P<10(-3)) but not in brain extracts (35+/-12 pg/ml versus 32+/-9 pg/ml, P>0.05). Endomorphin-2 levels in the two groups were in the same range for plasma and brain extracts. CD26-/- mice displayed short latencies to nociceptive stimuli (hot plate test: 6.6+/-1.2 s versus 8.6+/-1.5 s, P<10(-4); tail pinch test: 3.1+/-0.6 s versus 4.2+/-0.8 s, P<10(-3)). Administration of an SP (NK1) receptor antagonist or DPP-IV to CD26-/- mice normalised latencies. DPP-IV inhibitors decreased latencies only in CD26+/+ mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations represent the first fundamental evidence showing that DPP-IV influences pain perception via modulation of the peripheral SP concentration. Our work also highlights the role of peripheral NK1 receptors in nociception.},

Yet CCK overactivity appears to be involved in submissive behaviour, and CCKB receptor expression and binding are increased in suicide victims and animal models of anxiety. Preliminary data suggest that involvement of CCK and its receptor subtypes in anxiety can be better described when focusing on distinct endophenotypes, and considering environmental contingencies and confounds originating from interactions with dopamin-, opioid- and glutamatergic neurotransmission. In contrast, NPY is an anti-anxiety peptide with robust effects in various animal models when administrated into several brain regions. Studies with non-peptide antagonists selective for receptor subtypes have revealed the role of endogenous NPY in active coping. At least Y1, Y2 and Y5 receptors in various brain regions are involved, with the strongest evidence for contribution of Y1.},

Yet, compared with MALDI and ESI–MS, SIMS has not made a significant impact in biological or biomedical research. The key features of the technique, namely high spatial resolution, high detection efficiency of ions spanning a wide m/z range, surface sensitivity and the high scan rates seem to match ideally with several questions posed at the cellular level. To this date, SIMS has had only limited success in the biological arena. Why is this and what is needed to change this? This discussion paper will critically review the advances and the usefulness of SIMS in biomedical research and compare it to other approaches that offer spatially resolved molecular information available to a researcher with a biological interest. We will demonstrate that the type of information generated by the various incarnations of SIMS is strongly dependent on sample preparation and surface condition and these phenomena are only poorly understood. Modern approaches such as the cluster gun developments, ME-SIMS, gold coating and MALDI stigmatic imaging on a SIMS instrument might change the perception of SIMS being a tool for semiconductor manufacturers and physicists, and might persuade biologists to use these innovative mass spectrometric imaging tools.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: In response to a meal, glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP) are released and modulate glycemic control. Normally these incretins are rapidly degraded by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4). DPP-4 inhibitors are a novel class of oral antihyperglycemic agents in development for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. The degree of DPP-4 inhibition and the level of active incretin augmentation required for glucose lowering efficacy after an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) were evaluated. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to examine the pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics, and tolerability of sitagliptin. DESIGN: This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-period, single-dose crossover study. SETTING: The study was conducted at six investigational sites. PATIENTS: The study population consisted of 58 patients with type 2 diabetes who were not on antihyperglycemic agents. INTERVENTIONS: Interventions included sitagliptin 25 mg, sitagliptin 200 mg, or placebo. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Measurements included plasma DPP-4 activity; post-OGTT glucose excursion; active and total incretin GIP levels; insulin, C-peptide, and glucagon concentrations; and sitagliptin pharmacokinetics. RESULTS: Sitagliptin dose-dependently inhibited plasma DPP-4 activity over 24 h, enhanced active GLP-1 and GIP levels, increased insulin/C-peptide, decreased glucagon, and reduced glycemic excursion after OGTTs administered at 2 and 24 h after single oral 25- or 200-mg doses of sitagliptin. Sitagliptin was generally well tolerated, with no hypoglycemic events. CONCLUSIONS: In this study in patients with type 2 diabetes, near maximal glucose-lowering efficacy of sitagliptin after single oral doses was associated with inhibition of plasma DPP-4 activity of 80% or greater, corresponding to a plasma sitagliptin concentration of 100 nm or greater, and an augmentation of active GLP-1 and GIP levels of 2-fold or higher after an OGTT.},

   abstract = {The type-I and -II insulin-like growth factors (IGF-I, II) are now established as survival- or proliferation-factors in many in vitro systems. Of note IGFs provide trophic support for multiple cell types or organ cultures explanted from various species, and delay the onset of programmed cell death (apoptosis) through the mitochondrial (intrinsic pathway) or by antagonizing activation of cytotoxic cytokine signaling (extrinsic pathway). In some instances, IGFs protect against other forms of death such as necrosis or autophagy. The effect of IGFs on cell survival appears to be context specific, being determined both by the cell origin (tissue specific) and the cellular stress that induces loss of cellular viability. In many human cancers, there is a strong association with dysregulated IGF signaling, and this association has been extensively reviewed recently. IGF-regulation is also disrupted in childhood cancers as a consequence of chromosomal translocations. IGFs are implicated also in acute renal failure, traumatic injury to brain tissue, and cardiac disease. This article focuses on the role of IGFs and their cellular signaling pathways that provide survival signals in stressed cells.},

   abstract = {DPP8 belongs to the family of prolyl dipeptidases, which are capable of cleaving the peptide bond after a penultimate proline residue. Unlike DPP-IV, a drug target for type II diabetes, no information is available on the crystal structure of DPP8, the regulation of its enzymatic activity, or its substrate specificity. In this study, using analytical ultracentrifugation and native gel electrophoresis, we show that the DPP8 protein is predominantly dimeric when purified or in the cell extracts. Four conserved residues in the C-terminal loop of DPP8 (Phe(822), Val(833), Tyr(844), and His(859)), corresponding to those located at the dimer interface of DPP-IV, were individually mutated to Ala. Surprisingly, unlike DPP-IV, these single-site mutations abolished the enzymatic activity of DPP8 without disrupting its quaternary structure, indicating that dimerization itself is not sufficient for the optimal enzymatic activity of DPP8. Moreover, these mutations not only decreased k(cat), as did the corresponding DPP-IV mutations, but also dramatically increased K(m). We further show that the K(m) effect is independent of the substrate assayed. Finally, we identified the distinctive and strict substrate selectivity of DPP8 for hydrophobic or basic residues at the P2 site, which is in sharp contrast to the much less discriminative substrate specificity of DPP-IV. Our study has identified the residues absolutely required for the optimal activity of DPP8 and its unique substrate specificity. This study extends the functional importance of the C-terminal loop to the whole family of prolyl dipeptidases.},

   abstract = {Circulating antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme (APCE) has a role in fibrinolysis and appears structurally similar to fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a cell-surface proteinase that promotes invasiveness of certain epithelial cancers. To explore this potential relationship, we performed comparative structure/function analyses of the 2 enzymes. APCE from human plasma and recombinant FAP (rFAP) exhibited identical pH optima of 7.5, extinction coefficients (in(280 nm)(1%)) of 20.2 and 20.5, common sequences of tryptic peptides, and cross-reactivity with FAP antibody. APCE and rFAP are homodimers with monomeric subunits of 97 and 93 kDa. Only homodimers appear to have enzymatic activity, with essentially identical kinetics toward Met-alpha2-antiplasmin (Met-alpha2AP) and peptide substrates. APCE and rFAP cleave both Pro3-Leu4 and Pro12-Asn13 bonds of Met-alpha2AP, but relative kcat/Km values for Pro12-Asn13 are about 16-fold higher than for Pro3-Leu4. APCE and rFAP demonstrate higher kcat/Km values toward a peptide modeled on P4-P4' sequence surrounding the Pro12-Asn13 primary cleavage site than for Z-Gly-Pro-AMC and Ala-Pro-AFC substrates. These data support APCE as a soluble derivative of FAP and Met-alpha2AP as its physiologic substrate. Conversion of Met-alpha2AP by membrane or soluble FAP to the more easily fibrin-incorporable form, Asn-alpha2AP, may increase plasmin inhibition within fibrin surrounding certain neoplasms and have an impact on growth and therapeutic susceptibility.},

   abstract = {Proteome science relies on bioinformatics tools to characterize proteins via their proteolytic peptides which are identified via characteristic mass spectra generated after their ions undergo fragmentation in the gas phase within the mass spectrometer. The resulting secondary ion mass spectra are compared with protein sequence databases in order to identify the amino acid sequence. Although these search tools (e.g. SEQUEST, Mascot, X!Tandem, Phenyx) are frequently successful, much is still not understood about the amino acid sequence patterns which promote/protect particular fragmentation pathways, and hence lead to the presence/absence of particular ions from different ion series. In order to advance this area, we have developed a database, PepSeeker (http://nwsr.smith.man.ac.uk/pepseeker), which captures this peptide identification and ion information from proteome experiments. The database currently contains >185 000 peptides and associated database search information. Users may query this resource to retrieve peptide, protein and spectral information based on protein or peptide information, including the amino acid sequence itself represented by regular expressions coupled with ion series information. We believe this database will be useful to proteome researchers wishing to understand gas phase peptide ion chemistry in order to improve peptide identification strategies.

   abstract = {Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 enhances the activity of incretin hormones, improving glycemic control in subjects with type 2 diabetes. This twelve-week randomized, double-masked, placebo-controlled study assessed the efficacy and tolerability of the specific and potent oral dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor, vildagliptin (25 mg, bid, n=70) VS. placebo (bid, n=28) in previously diet-treated subjects with type 2 diabetes. Standardized meal tests were performed at baseline and endpoint. The between-group difference in adjusted mean change in HbA1c from baseline to endpoint was - 0.6 +/- 0.2 % (p=0.0012) for the whole cohort (baseline 8.0 %) and -1.2 % for subjects with baseline HbA1c 8.0 - 9.5 %. Fasting glucose and mean prandial glucose were reduced by 1.1 +/- 0.4 (p=0.0043) and 1.9 +/- 0.5 mmol/l (p <0.0001), respectively. The between-group differences in corrected insulin response at peak glucose and mean prandial C-peptide were + 0.06 +/- 0.02 (p=0.0258) and + 0.10 +/- 0.03 nmol/l (p=0.0031), respectively. Vildagliptin had no effect on fasting lipid levels or body weight. The incidence of adverse events was similar in subjects receiving placebo (71.4 %) and vildagliptin (55.7 %). CONCLUSION: monotherapy with vildagliptin is well tolerated and improves glycemic control in diet-treated subjects with type 2 diabetes. Concomitant improvements in beta-cell function were also observed. Subjects with higher baseline HbA1c levels showed greater response.},

   abstract = {The ectoenzymes dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV, CD26) and aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) have been implicated in the regulation of T cell activation and function. Both DP IV and APN serve as targets of efficient enzymatic inhibitors which induce autocrine production of TGF-beta1 and subsequent suppression of T cell proliferation and cytokine release. Here, we tested the hypothesis that the simultaneous inhibition of DP IV and APN enzymatic activity on leukocytes potentiates the anti-inflammatory effect of single DP IV or APN inhibitors. Our data show that the combined application of DP IV and APN inhibitors increased suppression of DNA synthesis in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells and isolated T cells in vitro when compared to the use of a single ectopeptidase inhibitor. Moreover, the combined action of DP IV and APN inhibitors markedly increased TGF-beta1 production associated with the observed immunosuppressive effects. In vivo, targeting DP IV and APN provided a potent therapeutic approach for the treatment of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, an animal model of multiple sclerosis. Taken together, our study suggests that combined DP IV and APN inhibition on pathogenic T cells represents a novel and efficient therapy for autoimmune disease of the central nervous system by a mechanism that involves an active TGF-beta1-mediated anti-inflammatory effect at the site of pathology.},

   abstract = {Type 2 diabetes is now one of the most challenging health-care problems, and novel treatment strategies are required. The pancreatic islet dysfunction of type 2 diabetes involves problems with both insulin and glucagon since appropriate levels of both hormones are required for maintenance of glucose homeostasis. Enhancement of pancreatic function by incretins such as glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-1 is a new therapeutic approach. These incretins are inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4. Vildagliptin is a potent, orally active, highly selective DPP-4 inhibitor that enhances the antidiabetic actions of the incretins. Pharmacokinetic studies showed that it is absorbed rapidly but has a sufficiently long period of action to require only once-daily dosing. Three phase II studies of vildagliptin use for 12 weeks in patients with type 2 diabetes have been reported. When vildagliptin was used either as monotherapy or combined with metformin, the treatment versus placebo resulted in significant reductions in hemoglobin (Hb)A(1c). The HbA(1c) was maintained during extended treatment over one year in the study of combination use with metformin. The studies indicated that the greater glycemic control appears to reflect an improvement in islet function. The improvement in glycemic control with vildagliptin was not associated with any body weight gain. Vildagliptin did not cause any clinically relevant changes in safety and was well tolerated. Therefore, further studies are being carried out on vildagliptin to assess long-term efficacy and safety in patients with type 2 diabetes.},

Although the diversity of targets giving rise to this new generation of anticancer drugs has expanded, many challenges persist in the design of effective treatment regimens. The complex interplay of signal-transduction pathways further complicates the customization of cancer treatments to target single mechanisms. However, despite uncertainty over precise or dominant mechanisms of action, especially for compounds targeting multiple gene products, emerging agents are producing significant therapeutic advances against a broad range of human cancers.},

   abstract = {AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV) inhibitors are currently being developed to prolong the biological activity of insulinotropic peptides as a novel approach in the treatment of diabetes. We hypothesised that DP IV inhibition could attenuate the satiety actions of peptide YY (PYY) by altering the conversion of PYY(1-36) to PYY(3-36). MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effects of PYY delivered by osmotic mini-pumps were assessed in rats treated with a DP IV inhibitor and in a rat model deficient in DP IV. RESULTS: Pharmacological levels of total PYY were found in the circulation after the exogenous administration of PYY(3-36). While both PYY(1-36) and PYY(3-36) reduced food intake in normal rats, PYY(1-36) was ineffective in rats deficient in DP IV. When re-fed after a 24-h fast, DP IV-deficient rats exhibited higher food intake and weight gain than normal rats. Moreover, unlike controls, there was no postprandial increase in PYY levels in DP IV-deficient rats. Despite these findings, administration of a DP IV inhibitor, Pro-boroPro, did not alter the acute anorectic effects of exogenous PYY(1-36) in normal rats. This could be the result of the protection of other appetite regulatory peptides or the generation of PYY(3-36) by remaining DP IV activity or other dipeptidyl peptidases. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Although DP IV inhibition with Pro-boroPro attenuated the generation of PYY(3-36), our results indicate that short-term DP IV inhibition does not eliminate the satiety actions of exogenously administered PYY(1-36) at the doses tested.},

A range of exciting new technology has been developed and enthusiastically applied to an enormous variety of biological questions. However, the degree of stringency required in proteomic data generation and analysis appears to have been underestimated. As a result, there are likely to be numerous published findings that are of questionable quality, requiring further confirmation and/or validation. This manuscript outlines a number of key issues in proteomic research, including those associated with experimental design, differential display and biomarker discovery, protein identification and analytical incompleteness. In an effort to set a standard that reflects current thinking on the necessary and desirable characteristics of publishable manuscripts in the field, a minimal set of guidelines for proteomics research is then described. These guidelines will serve as a set of criteria which editors of PROTEOMICS will use for assessment of future submissions to the Journal.},

   abstract = {The dipeptidyl peptidase IV gene family contains the four peptidases dipeptidyl peptidase IV, fibroblast activation protein, dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9. Dipeptidyl peptidase IV and fibroblast activation protein are involved in cell-extracellular matrix interactions and tissue remodeling. Fibroblast activation protein is upregulated and dipeptidyl peptidase IV is dysregulated in chronic liver disease. The effects of dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 on cell adhesion, cell migration, wound healing and apoptosis were measured by using green fluorescent protein fusion proteins to identify transfected cells. Dipeptidyl peptidase 9-overexpressing cells exhibited impaired cell adhesion, migration in transwells and monolayer wound healing on collagen I, fibronectin and Matrigel. Dipeptidyl peptidase 8-overexpressing cells exhibited impaired cell migration on collagen I and impaired wound healing on collagen I and fibronectin in comparison to the green fluorescent protein-transfected controls. Dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 enhanced induced apoptosis, and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 overexpression increased spontaneous apoptosis. Mechanistic investigations showed that neither the catalytic serine of dipeptidyl peptidase 8 or dipeptidyl peptidase 9 nor the Arg-Gly-Asp integrin-binding motif in dipeptidyl peptidase 9 were required for the impairment of cell survival, cell adhesion or wound healing. We have previously shown that the in vitro roles of dipeptidyl peptidase IV and fibroblast activation protein in cell-extracellular matrix interactions and apoptosis are similarly independent of catalytic activity. Dipeptidyl peptidase 9 overexpression reduced beta-catenin, tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases 2 and discoidin domain receptor 1 expression. This is the first demonstration that dipeptidyl peptidase 8 and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 influence cell-extracellular matrix interactions, and thus may regulate tissue remodeling.},

   abstract = {Inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP-4) is a novel treatment for type-2 diabetes. DPP-4 inhibition prevents the inactivation of glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1), which increases levels of active GLP-1. This increases insulin secretion and reduces glucagon secretion, thereby lowering glucose levels. Several DPP-4 inhibitors are in clinical development. Most experience so far has been with sitagliptin (Merck; approved by the FDA) and vildagliptin (Novartis; filed). These are orally active compounds with a long duration, allowing once-daily administration. Both sitagliptin and vildagliptin improve metabolic control in type-2 diabetes, both in monotherapy and in combination with metformin and thiazolidinediones. A reduction in HbA(1c) of approximately 1% is seen in studies of DPP-4 inhibition of up to 52 weeks' duration. DPP-4 inhibition is safe and well tolerated, the risk of hypoglycaemia is minimal, and DPP-4 inhibition is body-weight neutral. DPP-4 inhibition is suggested to be a first-line treatment of type-2 diabetes, particularly in its early stages in combination with metformin. However, the durability and long-term safety of DPP-4 inhibition remain to be established.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Pharmacotherapies that augment the incretin pathway have recently become available, but their role in the management of type 2 diabetes is not well defined. OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy and safety of incretin-based therapy in adults with type 2 diabetes based on randomized controlled trials published in peer-reviewed journals or as abstracts. DATA SOURCES: We searched MEDLINE (1966-May 20, 2007) and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (second quarter, 2007) for English-language randomized controlled trials involving an incretin mimetic (glucagonlike peptide 1 [GLP-1] analogue) or enhancer (dipeptidyl peptidase 4 [DPP4] inhibitor). We also searched prescribing information, relevant Web sites, reference lists and citation sections of recovered articles, and abstracts presented at recent conferences. STUDY SELECTION: Randomized controlled trials were selected if they were at least 12 weeks in duration, compared incretin therapy with placebo or other diabetes medication, and reported hemoglobin A(1c) data in nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes. DATA EXTRACTION: Two reviewers independently assessed trials for inclusion and extracted data. Differences were resolved by consensus. Meta-analyses were conducted for several efficacy and safety outcomes. RESULTS: Of 355 potentially relevant articles identified, 51 were retrieved for detailed evaluation and 29 met the inclusion criteria. Incretins lowered hemoglobin A(1c) compared with placebo (weighted mean difference, -0.97% [95% confidence interval {CI}, -1.13% to -0.81%] for GLP-1 analogues and -0.74% [95% CI, -0.85% to -0.62%] for DPP4 inhibitors) and were noninferior to other hypoglycemic agents. Glucagonlike peptide 1 analogues resulted in weight loss (1.4 kg and 4.8 kg vs placebo and insulin, respectively) while DPP4 inhibitors were weight neutral. Glucagonlike peptide 1 analogues had more gastrointestinal side effects (risk ratio, 2.9 [95% CI, 2.0-4.2] for nausea and 3.2 [95% CI, 2.5-4.4] for vomiting). Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 inhibitors had an increased risk of infection (risk ratio, 1.2 [95% CI, 1.0-1.4] for nasopharyngitis and 1.5 [95% CI, 1.0-2.2] for urinary tract infection) and headache (risk ratio, 1.4 [95% CI, 1.1-1.7]). All but 3 trials had a 30-week or shorter duration; thus, long-term efficacy and safety could not be evaluated. CONCLUSIONS: Incretin therapy offers an alternative option to currently available hypoglycemic agents for nonpregnant adults with type 2 diabetes, with modest efficacy and a favorable weight-change profile. Careful postmarketing surveillance for adverse effects, especially among the DPP4 inhibitors, and continued evaluation in longer-term studies and in clinical practice are required to determine the role of this new class among current pharmacotherapies for type 2 diabetes.},

   abstract = {This review focuses on the mechanisms regulating the synthesis, secretion, biological actions, and therapeutic relevance of the incretin peptides glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1). The published literature was reviewed, with emphasis on recent advances in our understanding of the biology of GIP and GLP-1. GIP and GLP-1 are both secreted within minutes of nutrient ingestion and facilitate the rapid disposal of ingested nutrients. Both peptides share common actions on islet beta-cells acting through structurally distinct yet related receptors. Incretin-receptor activation leads to glucose-dependent insulin secretion, induction of beta-cell proliferation, and enhanced resistance to apoptosis. GIP also promotes energy storage via direct actions on adipose tissue, and enhances bone formation via stimulation of osteoblast proliferation and inhibition of apoptosis. In contrast, GLP-1 exerts glucoregulatory actions via slowing of gastric emptying and glucose-dependent inhibition of glucagon secretion. GLP-1 also promotes satiety and sustained GLP-1-receptor activation is associated with weight loss in both preclinical and clinical studies. The rapid degradation of both GIP and GLP-1 by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 has led to the development of degradation-resistant GLP-1-receptor agonists and dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. These agents decrease hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) safely without weight gain in subjects with type 2 diabetes. GLP-1 and GIP integrate nutrient-derived signals to control food intake, energy absorption, and assimilation. Recently approved therapeutic agents based on potentiation of incretin action provide new physiologically based approaches for the treatment of type 2 diabetes.},

   abstract = {Angioedema is an underestimated clinical problem. Many cases are nonallergic reactions, e.g. bradykinin-induced angioedema caused by genetic defects and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. This difference is crucial for successful therapy, in particular when complete emergency care is not available. Five important forms of nonallergic angioedema can be distinguished: hereditary (HAE), acquired (AAE), renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS)-blocker-induced (RAE), pseudoallergic angioedema (PAE) and idiopathic angioedema (IAE). Some angioedema are present in the larynx and may cause death. A vast majority of nonallergic angioedema are RAE, particularly those caused by ACE inhibitors. It appears important to emphasize that in patients with complete intolerance to RAAS-blockers, cessation of RAAS-blockers is likely to be associated with increased cardiovascular risk. Currently, there is no published algorithm for diagnosis and treatment. Angioedema is usually treated by a conservative clinical approach using artificial ventilation, glucocorticoids and antihistamines. Today, a plasma pool C1-esterase inhibitor (C1-INH) concentrate is the therapy of choice in HAE. The current pharmacotherapy of nonallergic angioedema is not satisfactory, thus requiring the identification of effective agents in clinical trials. Recently, several new drugs were developed: a recombinant C1-INH, a kallikrein inhibitor (ecallantide) and a specific bradykinin-B2-receptor antagonist (icatibant). According to currently available reports, these drugs may improve the treatment of kinin-induced angioedema.},

   abstract = {The specificity of blood coagulation proteinases for substrate, inhibitor, and effector recognition is mediated by exosites on the surfaces of the catalytic domains, physically separated from the catalytic site. Some thrombin ligands bind specifically to either exosite I or II, while others engage both exosites. The involvement of different, overlapping constellations of exosite residues enables binding of structurally diverse ligands. The flexibility of the thrombin structure is central to the mechanism of complex formation and the specificity of exosite interactions. Encounter complex formation is driven by electrostatic ligand-exosite interactions, followed by conformational rearrangement to a stable complex. Exosites on some zymogens are in low affinity proexosite states and are expressed concomitant with catalytic site activation. The requirement for exosite expression controls the specificity of assembly of catalytic complexes on the coagulation pathway, such as the membrane-bound factor Xa*factor Va (prothrombinase) complex, and prevents premature assembly. Substrate recognition by prothrombinase involves a two-step mechanism with initial docking of prothrombin to exosites, followed by a conformational change to engage the FXa catalytic site. Prothrombin and its activation intermediates bind prothrombinase in two alternative conformations determined by the zymogen to proteinase transition that are hypothesized to involve prothrombin (pro)exosite I interactions with FVa, which underpin the sequential activation pathway. The role of exosites as the major source of substrate specificity has stimulated development of exosite-targeted anticoagulants for treatment of thrombosis.},

RCC1 associates dynamically with chromatin through binding to histones H2A and/or H2B in a Ran-regulated manner. Here, we report that, unexpectedly, the amino-terminal serine or proline residue of RCC1 is uniquely methylated on its alpha-amino group. Methylation requires removal of the initiating methionine, and the presence of proline and lysine at positions 3 and 4, respectively. Methylation-defective mutants of RCC1 bind less effectively than wild-type protein to chromatin during mitosis, which causes spindle-pole defects. We propose a bimodal attachment mechanism for RCC1 in which the tail promotes stable RCC1 association with chromatin through DNA binding in an alpha-N-methylation-dependent manner. These data provide the first known function for N-terminal protein methylation.},

   abstract = {The circulating enzyme, alpha2-antiplasmin cleaving enzyme (APCE), has very similar sequence homology and proteolytic specificity as fibroblast activation protein (FAP), a membrane-bound proteinase. FAP is expressed on activated fibroblasts associated with rapid tissue growth as in embryogenesis, wound healing, and epithelial-derived malignancies, but not in normal tissues. Its presence on stroma suggests that FAP functions to remodel extracellular matrix (ECM) during neoplastic growth. Precise biologic substrates have not been defined for FAP, although like APCE, it cleaves alpha2-antiplasmin to a derivative more easily cross-linked to fibrin. While FAP has been shown to cleave gelatin, evidence for cleavage of native collagen, the major ECM component, remains indistinct. We examined the potential proteolytic effects of FAP or APCE alone and in concert with selected matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) on collagens I, III, and IV. SDS-PAGE analyses demonstrated that neither FAP nor APCE cleaves collagen I. Following collagen I cleavage by MMP-1, however, FAP or APCE digested collagen I into smaller peptides. These peptides were analogous to, yet different from, those produced by MMP-9 following MMP-1 cleavage. Amino-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses of digestion mixtures identified several peptide fragments within the sequences of the two collagen chains. The proteolytic synergy of APCE in the cleavage of collagen I and III was not observed with collagen IV. We conclude that FAP works in synchrony with other proteinases to cleave partially degraded or denatured collagen I and III as ECM is excavated, and that derivative peptides might function to regulate malignant cell growth and motility.},

Mass spectrometry has emerged as the preferred method for in-depth characterization of the protein components of biological systems. Using mass spectrometry, key insights into the composition, regulation and function of molecular complexes and pathways have been gained. From these studies, it is clear that mass-spectrometry-based proteomics is now a powerful 'hypothesis-generating engine' that, when combined with complementary molecular, cellular and pharmacological techniques, provides a framework for translating large data sets into an understanding of complex biological processes.},

   abstract = {Pharmacology over the past 100 years has had a rich tradition of scientists with the ability to form qualitative or semi-quantitative relations between molecular structure and activity in cerebro. To test these hypotheses they have consistently used traditional pharmacology tools such as in vivo and in vitro models. Increasingly over the last decade however we have seen that computational (in silico) methods have been developed and applied to pharmacology hypothesis development and testing. These in silico methods include databases, quantitative structure-activity relationships, pharmacophores, homology models and other molecular modeling approaches, machine learning, data mining, network analysis tools and data analysis tools that use a computer. In silico methods are primarily used alongside the generation of in vitro data both to create the model and to test it. Such models have seen frequent use in the discovery and optimization of novel molecules with affinity to a target, the clarification of absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity properties as well as physicochemical characterization. The aim of this review is to illustrate some of the in silico methods for pharmacology that are used in drug discovery. Further applications of these methods to specific targets and their limitations will be discussed in the second accompanying part of this review.},

   abstract = {N-terminal truncation of NPY has important physiological consequences, because the truncated peptides lose their capability to activate the Y1-receptor. The sources of N-terminally truncated NPY and related peptides are unknown and several proline specific peptidases may be involved. First, we therefore provide an overview on the peptidases, belonging to structural and functional homologues of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DP4) as well as aminopeptidase P (APP) and thus, represent potential candidates of NPY cleavage in vivo. Second, applying selective inhibitors against DP4, DP8/9 and DP2, respectively, the enzymatic distribution was analyzed in brain extracts from wild type and DP4 deficient F344 rat substrains and human plasma samples in activity studies as well as by matrix assisted laser desorption/ionisation-time of flight (MALDI-TOF)-mass spectrometry. Third, co-transfection of Cos-1 cells with Dpp4 and Npy followed by confocal lasermicroscopy illustrated that hNPY-dsRed1-N1 was transported in large dense core vesicles towards the membrane while rDP4-GFP-C1 was transported primarily in different vesicles thereby providing no clear evidence for co-localization of NPY and DP4. Nevertheless, the review and experimental results of activity and mass spectrometry studies support the notion that at least five peptidases (DP4, DP8, DP9, XPNPEP1, XPNPEP2) are potentially involved in NPY cleavage while the serine protease DP4 (CD26) could be the principal peptidase involved in the N-terminal truncation of NPY. However, DP8 and DP9 are also capable of cleaving NPY, whereas no cleavage could be demonstrated for DP2.},

Thousands of highly specific proteolytic events are associated with normal and pathological conditions, including bacterial and viral infections. However, the information about individual proteolytic events is dispersed over multiple publications and is not easily available for large-scale analysis. CutDB is one of the first systematic efforts to build an easily accessible collection of documented proteolytic events for natural proteins in vivo or in vitro. A CutDB entry is defined by a unique combination of these three attributes: protease, protein substrate and cleavage site. Currently, CutDB integrates 3070 proteolytic events for 470 different proteases captured from public archives (such as MEROPS and HPRD) and publications. CutDB supports various types of data searches and displays, including clickable network diagrams. Most importantly, CutDB is a community annotation resource based on a Wikipedia approach, providing a convenient user interface to input new data online. A recent contribution of 568 proteolytic events by several experts in the field of matrix metallopeptidases suggests that this approach will significantly accelerate the development of CutDB content. CutDB is publicly available at http://cutdb.burnham.org.},

In this study, a highly predictive CoMFA model based on the fast-docking for DPP4, DPP8, and DPP9 inhibitors was obtained. This reliable model showed leave-one-out cross-validation q(2) and conventional r(2) values of 0.68 and 0.96 for the DPP4 inhibitors, 0.58 and 0.98 for the DPP8 inhibitors, and 0.68 and 0.97 for the DPP9 inhibitors, respectively. The validation of the CoMFA model was confirmed by the compounds in the test set, including the synthesized six- and seven-membered cyclic hydrazines. According to this study, to obtain selective DPP4 inhibitors compared to their isozymes, the interaction of the inhibitors with the S3 site and S1' site in DPP4 must be considered. The proposed newly synthesized compounds, KR64300 and KR64301, interact well with the sites mentioned above, showing excellent selectivity.},

   abstract = {Extensive preclinical studies suggest neuropeptide Y (NPY) to be involved in stress regulation and coping. NPY counteracts the behavioral consequences of stress and anxiety to maintain emotional homeostasis. NPY is also involved in learning, memory, and cognition, all of which are dysregulated in many psychiatric states. Dense localization of NPY and NPY receptors is found in brain areas implicated in psychopathology such as the amygdala, hippocampus, neocortex, septum, caudate-putamen, hypothalamus and locus coeruleus. Impaired central NPY signaling may therefore be involved in the pathophysiology of depression, anxiety, schizophrenia, alcoholism, and trauma-induced disorders like PTSD. Studies on the readily accessible plasma from psychiatric patients have provided some information on the relevance of NPY as a marker for sympathetic tone in certain conditions. Reports on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) NPY in subjects with depression indicate a dysregulation of central NPY in this disorder, however, other conditions still need to be investigated.},

   abstract = {An atmospheric pressure (AP) MALDI imaging interface was developed for an orthogonal acceleration time-of-flight mass spectrometer and utilized to analyze peptides, carbohydrates, and other small biomolecules using infrared laser excitation. In molecular imaging experiments, the spatial distribution of mock peptide patterns was recovered with a detection limit of approximately 1 fmol/pixel from a variety of MALDI matrixes. With the use of oversampling for the image acquisition, a spatial resolution of 40 microm, 5 times smaller than the laser spot size, was achieved. This approach, however, required that the analyte was largely removed at the point of analysis before the next point was interrogated. Native water in plant tissue was demonstrated to be an efficient natural matrix for AP infrared laser desorption ionization. In soft fruit tissues from bananas, grapes, and strawberries, potassiated ions of the most abundant metabolites, small carbohydrates, and their clusters produced the strongest peaks in the spectra. Molecular imaging of a strawberry skin sample revealed the distribution of the sucrose, glucose/fructose, and citric acid species around the embedded seeds. Infrared AP MALDI mass spectrometric imaging without the addition of an artificial matrix enables the in vivo investigation of small biomolecules and biological processes (e.g., metabolomics) in their natural environment.},

   abstract = {An increasing number of biological processes appear to be regulated by Pro-specific N-terminal processing. The proline-specific dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs) like DPPIV, fibroblast activation protein α (FAP), DPPII, DPP8 and DPP9, because of their preference for cleavage after X-Pro in vitro, are likely to be involved in many of these processes. These DPPs are emerging as an important protease family with roles in the regulation of signaling by peptide hormones. Dipeptidyl peptidase II (DPPII, E.C. 3.4.14.2) is an intracellular protease that localizes to the vesicular system. It releases, preferably at acidic pH, N-terminal dipeptides from oligopeptides with Pro or Ala in the penultimate position. Despite the fact that the physiological role of DPPII still has not been elucidated, several suggestions were made on possible functions of the enzyme depending on its localization in different cells, body fluids and organs. DPPII was a.o. suggested to be involved in the processes of cell differentiation and in the protection from cell death, and to have a role in the degradation of collagen fragments, myofibrillar proteins and short neuropeptides. Moreover, changes in the level and distribution of the enzyme provided clues indicating additional roles in disease-related processes. Here we review the DPPII literature, aiming to bring more clarity in the disperse data on this subject and give a state of the art on DPPII research.},

Inhibitors of DPPs have an intriguing, therapeutic potential, with clinical efficacy seen in patients with diabetes. Until now, only recombinant forms of DPP8 and DPP9 have been characterized. Their enzymatic activities have not been demonstrated in or purified from any natural source. Using several selective DPP inhibitors, we show that DPP activity, attributable to DPP8/9 is present in human PBMC. All leukocyte types tested (lymphocytes, monocytes, Jurkat, and U937 cells) were shown to contain similar DPP8/9-specific activities, and DPPII- and DPPIV-specific activities varied considerably. The results were confirmed by DPPIV/CD26 immunocapture experiments. Subcellular fractionation localized the preponderance of DPP8/9 activity to the cytosol and DPPIV in the membrane fractions. Using Jurkat cell cytosol as a source, a 30-fold, enriched DPP preparation was obtained, which had enzymatic characteristics closely related to the ones of DPP8 and/or -9, including inhibition by allo-Ile-isoindoline and affinity for immobilized Lys-isoindoline.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a widely distributed 110-kDa cell surface glycoprotein with an important role in T-cell costimulation. We demonstrated previously that CD26 binds to caveolin-1 in antigen-presenting cells, and following exogenous CD26 stimulation, Tollip and IRAK-1 disengage from caveolin-1 in antigen-presenting cells. IRAK-1 is then subsequently phosphorylated to up-regulate CD86 expression, resulting in subsequent T-cell proliferation. However, it is unclear whether caveolin-1 is a costimulatory ligand for CD26 in T-cells. Using soluble caveolin-1-Fc fusion protein, we now show that caveolin-1 is the costimulatory ligand for CD26, and that ligation of CD26 by caveolin-1 induces T-cell proliferation and NF-kappaB activation in a T-cell receptor/CD3-dependent manner. We also demonstrated that the cytoplasmic tail of CD26 interacts with CARMA1 in T-cells, resulting in signaling events that lead to NF-kappaB activation. Ligation of CD26 by caveolin-1 recruits a complex consisting of CD26, CARMA1, Bcl10, and IkappaB kinase to lipid rafts. Taken together, our findings provide novel insights into the regulation of T-cell costimulation via the CD26 molecule.},

The results resolved chromosomal positions for 663,480 contigs, 20,285 putative feline gene orthologs, and 133,499 conserved sequence blocks (CSBs). Additional annotated features include repetitive elements, endogenous retroviral sequences, nuclear mitochondrial (numt) sequences, micro-RNAs, and evolutionary breakpoints that suggest historic balancing of translocation and inversion incidences in distinct mammalian lineages. Large numbers of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), deletion insertion polymorphisms (DIPs), and short tandem repeats (STRs), suitable for linkage or association studies were characterized in the context of long stretches of chromosome homozygosity. In spite of the light coverage capturing ∼65% of euchromatin sequence from the cat genome, these comparative insights shed new light on the tempo and mode of gene/genome evolution in mammals, promise several research applications for the cat, and also illustrate that a comparative approach using more deeply covered mammals provides an informative, preliminary annotation of a light (1.9-fold) coverage mammal genome sequence.},

   abstract = {The T cell marker CD26/dipeptidyl peptidase (DP) IV is associated with an effector phenotype and markedly elevated in the human CNS disorder multiple sclerosis. However, little is known about the in vivo role of CD26/DP IV in health and disease, and the underlying mechanism of its function in CNS inflammation. To directly address the role of CD26/DP IV in vivo, we examined Th1 immune responses and susceptibility to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis in CD26(-/-) mice. We show that gene deletion of CD26 in mice leads to deregulation of Th1 immune responses. Although production of IFN-gamma and TNF-alpha by pathogenic T cells in response to myelin Ag was enhanced in CD26(-/-) mice, production of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta1 was diminished in vivo and in vitro. In contrast to the reduction in TGF-beta1 production, responsiveness to external TGF-beta1 was normal in T cells from CD26(-/-) mice, excluding alterations in TGF-beta1 sensitivity as a mechanism causing the loss of immune regulation. Natural ligands of CD26/DP IV induced TGF-beta1 production in T cells from wild-type mice. However, natural ligands of CD26/DP IV failed to elicit TGF-beta1 production in T cells from CD26(-/-) mice. The striking functional deregulation of Th1 immunity was also seen in vivo. Thus, clinical experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis scores were significantly increased in CD26(-/-) mice immunized with peptide from myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein. These results identify CD26/DP IV as a nonredundant inhibitory receptor controlling T cell activation and Th1-mediated autoimmunity, and may have important therapeutic implications for the treatment of autoimmune CNS disease.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DP4) inhibitors are currently under intensive investigation in late-stage clinical trials as a treatment for type II diabetes. Lack of selectivity toward the related enzymes DP8 and DP9 has recently emerged as a possible source of drug-induced toxicity. Unlike DP4, X-ray structures of DP8 and DP9 are not yet available. As an aid to understanding the structural basis for selectivity, the authors have constructed homology models of DP8 and DP9 based on the X-ray coordinates of DP4. Accurate sequence alignment reveals common structural features indicative for a well-preserved overall fold comprising two domains, namely, a hydrolase domain and a so-called beta-propeller, which together form the active site deeply buried within the protein. The conformation of two loops inside this deep cavity is particularly relevant for the active sites. The authors used a published protocol for loop prediction based on conformational sampling and energy analysis to generate plausible solutions for these two loops. The predictive power of the approach was successfully evaluated for the template protein DP4 and two additional known structures from the same protein family, namely, FAP and DPX. The authors also show that inclusion of the covalent ligand NVP-728 greatly enhances the refinement. Based on the established evaluation protocol, the corresponding loops of DP8 and DP9 were predicted and the resulting active sites were compared with DP4. In particular, the authors conclude that differences in the P2-pocket are relevant for the design of selective DP4 inhibitors. The loss of key interactions in DP8 and DP9 as predicted from their models is consistent with the selectivity profile of the DP4 clinical candidate MK-431.},

   abstract = {CD26 is a 110 kDa surface glycoprotein with intrinsic dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) activity that is expressed on numerous cell types and has a multitude of biological functions. An important aspect of CD26 biology is its peptidase activity and its functional and physical association with molecules with key roles in various cellular pathways and biological programs. CD26 role in immune regulation has been extensively characterized, with recent findings elucidating its linkage with signaling pathways and structures involved in T-lymphocyte activation as well as antigen presenting cell-T-cell interaction. Recent work also suggests that CD26 has a significant role in tumor biology, being both a marker of disease behavior clinically as well as playing an important role in tumor pathogenesis and development. In this paper, we will review emerging data that suggest CD26 may be an appropriate therapeutic target for the treatment of selected neoplasms and immune disorders. Through the use of various experimental approaches and agents to influence CD26/DPPIV expression and activity, such as anti-CD26 antibodies, CD26/DPPIV chemical inhibitors, siRNAs to inhibit CD26 expression, overexpressing CD26 transfectants and soluble CD26 molecules, our group has shown that CD26 interacts with structures with essential cellular functions. Its association with such key molecules as topoisomerase II alpha, p38 MAPK, and integrin PI, has important clinical implications, including its potential ability to regulate tumor sensitivity to selected chemotherapies and to influence tumor migration/metastases and tumorigenesis. Importantly, our recent in vitro and in vivo data support the hypothesis that CD26 may indeed be an appropriate target for therapy for selected cancers and immune disorders.},

   abstract = {Most known organisms encode proteases that are crucial for constitutive proteolytic events. In the present paper, we describe a method to define these events in proteomes from Escherichia coli to humans. The method takes advantage of specific N-terminal biotinylation of protein samples, followed by affinity enrichment and conventional LC (liquid chromatography)-MS/MS (tandem mass spectrometry) analysis. The method is simple, uses conventional and easily obtainable reagents, and is applicable to most proteomics facilities. As proof of principle, we demonstrate profiles of proteolytic events that reveal exquisite in vivo specificity of methionine aminopeptidase in E. coli and unexpected processing of mitochondrial transit peptides in yeast, mouse and human samples. Taken together, our results demonstrate how to rapidly distinguish real proteolysis that occurs in vivo from the predictions based on in vitro experiments.},

   abstract = {A highly consistent trait of tumor stromal fibroblasts is the induction of the membrane-bound serine protease fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP), which is overexpressed on the surface of reactive stromal fibroblasts present within the stroma of the majority of human epithelial tumors. In contrast, FAP is not expressed by tumor epithelial cells or by fibroblasts or other cell types in normal tissues. The proteolytic activity of FAP, therefore, represents a potential pan-tumor target that can be exploited for the release of potent cytotoxins from inactive prodrugs consisting of an FAP peptide substrate coupled to a cytotoxin. To identify FAP peptide substrates, we used liquid chromatography tandem mass spectroscopy based sequencing to generate a complete map of the FAP cleavage sites within human collagen I derived gelatin. Positional analysis of the frequency of each amino acid at each position within the cleavage sites revealed FAP consensus sequences PPGP and (D/E)-(R/K)-G-(E/D)-(T/S)-G-P. These studies further demonstrated that ranking cleavage sites based on the magnitude of the LC/MS/MS extracted ion current predicted FAP substrates that were cleaved with highest efficiency. Fluorescence-quenched peptides were synthesized on the basis of the cleavage sites with the highest ion current rankings, and kinetic parameters for FAP hydrolysis were determined. The substrate DRGETGP, which corresponded to the consensus sequence, had the lowest Km of 21 microM. Overall the Km values were relatively similar for both high and low ranked substrates, whereas the kcat values differed by up to 100-fold. On the basis of these results, the FAP consensus sequences are currently being evaluated as FAP-selective peptide carriers for incorporation into FAP-activated prodrugs.},

   abstract = {N-terminal truncation of chemokines by proteases including dipeptidyl peptidase (DP) IV significantly alters their biological activity; generally ablating cognate G-protein coupled receptor engagement and often generating potent receptor antagonists. DP8 is a recently recognised member of the prolyl oligopeptidase gene family that includes DPIV. Since DPIV is known to process chemokines we surveyed 27 chemokines for cleavage by DP8. We report DP8 cleavage of the N-terminal two residues of IP10 (CXCL10), ITAC (CXCL11) and SDF-1 (CXCL12). This has implications for DP8 substrate specificity. Chemokine cleavage and inactivation may occur in vivo upon cell lysis and release of DP8 or in the inactivation of internalized chemokine/receptor complexes.},

   abstract = {Inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) are driven by imbalances in innate and acquired immune response. In IBD two dysregulated T cell subsets are in the focus of interest: activated effector T cells and regulatory T cells. These T cell subsets are characterized by a strong expression of the ectopeptidases dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV /CD26) and aminopeptidase N (APN/CD13), which are thought to a role in the control of immune activation and in regulating cellular communication by hydrolyzing bioactive polypeptides. Since inhibitors of both enzymes were shown to be effective in limiting immune activation processes in vitro as well as in vivo, they emerged as new drug candidates for the treatment of diseases associated with an imbalanced T cell response, such as IBD. In this review we intent to throw light on the putative role of DPIV, APN and related enzymes in the regulation of immune and non-immune processes in inflammatory bowel diseases, on possible benefits from peptidase inhibitor therapy in these diseases as well on the gaps of knowledge in this field.},

MS can monitor thousands of individual molecular data channels measured as mass-to-charge (m/z). We describe the use of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) MS for the image analysis of proteins, peptides, lipids, drugs, and metabolites in tissues. We discuss the basic instrumentation and sample preparation methods needed to produce high-resolution images and high image reproducibility. Matrix-addition protocols are briefly discussed along with normal operating procedures, and selected biological and medical applications of MALDI imaging MS are described. We give examples of both two- and three-dimensional imaging, including normal mouse embryo implantation, sperm maturation in mouse epididymis, protein distributions in brain sections, protein alterations as a result of drug administration, and protein changes in brain due to neurodegeneration and tumor formation. Advantages of this technology and future challenges for its improvement are discussed.},

   abstract = {Human kallikrein-related peptidases (KLKs) are (chymo)-trypsin-like serine proteinases that are expressed in a variety of tissues such as prostate, ovary, breast, testis, brain, and skin. Although their physiological functions have been only partly elucidated, many of the KLKs appear to be useful prognostic cancer markers, showing distinct correlations between their expression levels and different stages of cancer. Recent advances in the purification of 'new type' recombinant KLKs allowed solution of the crystal structures of KLK4, KLK5, KLK6, and KLK7. Along with these data, enzyme kinetic studies and extended substrate specificity profiling have led to an understanding of the non-prime-side substrate preferences of KLK4, 5, 6, and 7. The shape and polarity of the specificity pockets S1-S4 explain well their substrate preferences. KLK4, 5, and 6 exhibit trypsin-like specificity, with a strong preference for Arg at the P1 position of substrates. In contrast, KLK7 displays a unique chymotrypsin-like specificity for Tyr, which is also preferred at P2. All four KLKs show little specificity for P3 residues and have a tendency to accept hydrophobic residues at P4. Interestingly, for KLK4, 5, and 7 extended charged surface regions were observed that most likely serve as exosites for physiological substrates.},

   abstract = {Post-translational modifications enable extra layers of control of the proteome, and perhaps the most important is proteolysis, a major irreversible modification affecting every protein. The intersection of the protease web with a proteome sculpts that proteome, dynamically modifying its state and function. Protease expression is distorted in cancer, so perturbing signaling pathways and the secretome of the tumor and reactive stromal cells. Indeed many cancer biomarkers are stable proteolytic fragments. It is crucial to determine which proteases contribute to the pathology versus their roles in homeostasis and in mitigating cancer. Thus the full substrate repertoire of a protease, termed the substrate degradome, must be deciphered to define protease function and to identify drug targets. Degradomics has been used to identify many substrates of matrix metalloproteinases that are important proteases in cancer. Here we review recent degradomics technologies that allow for the broadly applicable identification and quantification of proteases (the protease degradome) and their activity state, substrates, and interactors. Quantitative proteomics using stable isotope labeling, such as ICAT, isobaric tags for relative and absolute quantification (iTRAQ), and stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture (SILAC), can reveal protease substrates by taking advantage of the natural compartmentalization of membrane proteins that are shed into the extracellular space. Identifying the actual cleavage sites in a complex proteome relies on positional proteomics and utilizes selection strategies to enrich for protease-generated neo-N termini of proteins. In so doing, important functional information is generated. Finally protease substrates and interactors can be identified by interactomics based on affinity purification of protease complexes using exosite scanning and inactive catalytic domain capture strategies followed by mass spectrometry analysis. At the global level, the N terminome analysis of whole communities of proteases in tissues and organs in vivo provides a full scale understanding of the protease web and the web-sculpted proteome, so defining metadegradomics.},

   abstract = {Chemokines mediate the recruitment of leukocytes to the sites of inflammation. N-terminal truncation of chemokines by the protease dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) potentially restricts their activity during inflammatory processes such as allergic reactions, but direct evidence in vivo is very rare. After demonstrating that N-terminal truncation of the chemokine CCL11/eotaxin by DPPIV results in a loss of CCR3-mediated intracellular calcium mobilization and CCR3 internalization in human eosinophils, we focused on the in vivo role of CCL11 and provide direct evidence for specific kinetic and rate-determining effects by DPPIV-like enzymatic activity on CCL11-mediated responses of eosinophils. Namely, it is demonstrated that i.v. administration of CCL11 in wild-type F344 rats leads to mobilization of eosinophils into the blood, peaking at 30 min. This mobilization is significantly increased in DPPIV-deficient F344 rats. Intradermal administration of CCL11 is followed by a dose-dependent recruitment of eosinophils into the skin and is significantly more effective in DPPIV-deficient F344 mutants as well as after pharmacological inhibition of DPPIV. Interestingly, CCL11 application leads to an up-regulation of DPPIV, which is not associated with negative feedback inhibition via DPPIV-cleaved CCL11((3-74)). These findings demonstrate regulatory effects of DPPIV for the recruitment of eosinophils. Furthermore, they illustrate that inhibitors of DPPIV have the potential to interfere with chemokine-mediated effects in vivo including but not limited to allergy.},

   abstract = {Data integration is a perennial issue in bioinformatics, with many systems being developed and many technologies offered as a panacea for its resolution. The fact that it is still a problem indicates a persistence of underlying issues. Progress has been made, but we should ask "what lessons have been learnt?", and "what still needs to be done?" Semantic Web and Web 2.0 technologies are the latest to find traction within bioinformatics data integration. Now we can ask whether the Semantic Web, mashups, or their combination, have the potential to help. This paper is based on the opening invited talk by Carole Goble given at the Health Care and Life Sciences Data Integration for the Semantic Web Workshop collocated with WWW2007. The paper expands on that talk. We attempt to place some perspective on past efforts, highlight the reasons for success and failure, and indicate some pointers to the future.},

   abstract = {Binding of plasminogen (Pg) to cell-surface receptors colocalized with plasminogen activators promotes Pg activation and enables cells to utilize the proteolytic activity of plasmin (Pm). Proteolysis by Pm is necessary in several physiological and pathological processes requiring extracellular matrix degradation including cell migration, tumor cell invasion and metastasis. The binding of Pg to cell-surface receptors is regulated by two major structural features: L-lysine binding sites (LBS) and negatively charged sialic acid residues located on its carbohydrate chains. Pg uses its LBS to bind to a wide spectrum of cell-surface receptors whereas binding through its sialic acid residues is limited only to receptor proteins containing cationic pockets or lectin-like modules. In this review, we discuss both mechanisms, including the identification of DPP IV as a Pg receptor and the possible physiological role of Pg/Pm in complex with DPP IV and adenosine deaminase (ADA) and /or the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform NHE-3 in prostate cancer.},

   volume = {1245},

   abstract = {Although opioids are known to influence sleep–wake regulation, the neuroanatomic substrate(s) mediating these effects remain unresolved. We hypothesized that the influence of opiates on sleep may be mediated, at least in part, by the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO), a key cell group for producing behavioral sleep. By combining in situ hybridization for kappa and mu receptor mRNA with immunostaining of Fos expressed by VLPO cells during sleep we show that > 85% of sleep-active VLPO neurons contain mRNA for either or both opioid receptors. Microinfusions of a kappa receptor agonist into the VLPO region increased NREM sleep by 51% during the subjective night, whereas a mu receptor agonist increased wakefulness by 60% during the subjective day. The sleep- and wake-promoting effects of the kappa and mu agonists were blocked by prior administration of their respective antagonist. Combining retrograde tracing from the VLPO with immunohistochemistry for dynorphin (Dyn, the endogenous kappa receptor agonist) or endomorphin 1 (EM1, the endogenous mu receptor agonist) we show that the central lateral parabrachial subnucleus (PBcl) provides Dyn inputs to the VLPO, whereas hypothalamic histaminergic neurons provide EM1 inputs to the VLPO. In summary, results from the present study suggest that central opioid inputs to the VLPO may play a role in sleep–wake regulation and that the VLPO likely mediates the hypnotic response to high levels of opioid analgesics.},

Recent data from animal models indicate that the depletion of CSFs has therapeutic benefit in many inflammatory and/or autoimmune conditions and as a result, early-phase clinical trials targeting granulocyte/macrophage colony-stimulating factor and macrophage colony-stimulating factor have now commenced. The distinct biological features of CSFs offer opportunities for specific targeting, but with some associated risks. Here, I describe these biological features, discuss the probable specific outcomes of targeting CSFs in vivo and highlight outstanding questions that need to be addressed.},

   abstract = {While foreign pathogens and their products have long been known to activate the innate immune system, the recent recognition of a group of endogenous molecules that serve a similar function has provided a framework for understanding the overlap between the inflammatory responses activated by pathogens and injury. These endogenous molecules, termed alarmins, are normal cell constituents that can be released into the extracellular milieu during states of cellular stress or damage and subsequently activate the immune system. One nuclear protein, High mobility group box-1 (HMGB1), has received particular attention as fulfilling the functions of an alarmin by being involved in both infectious and non-infectious inflammatory conditions. Once released, HMGB1 signals through various receptors to activate immune cells involved in the immune process. Although initial studies demonstrated HMGB1 as a late mediator of sepsis, recent findings indicate HMGB1 to have an important role in models of non-infectious inflammation, such as autoimmunity, cancer, trauma, and ischemia reperfusion injury. Furthermore, in contrast to its pro-inflammatory functions, there is evidence that HMGB1 also has restorative effects leading to tissue repair and regeneration. The complex functions of HMGB1 as an archetypical alarmin are outlined here to review our current understanding of a molecule that holds the potential for treatment in many important human conditions.},

   abstract = {Solving biological problems in silico has posed many daunting challenges ranging from simulating the protein dynamics to function assignment for new sequences. One approach to such problems, machine learning, is to learn the solution from a set of examples. Machine learning has found wide application in many problem domains such as medical diagnosis, market analysis, traffic analysis among others. The key idea in machine learning is to direct the computer to learn how to solve a problem rather than explicitly give the solution to the computer. This chapter reviews a number of popular machine learning formulations and gives an example for each formulation using the modeling of protein-DNA interactions. Then we present recent applications of machine learning to a number of biological problems related to protein structure and function prediction. These include protein-RNA interactions, protein-membrane interactions, protein-protein interactions, protein-peptide interactions, single amino acid polymorphisms, subcellular localization, and protein structure predictions. © 2008 Elsevier B.V.

   abstract = {The efficiency of conversion of precursor ions to observable products for electron detachment dissociation (EDD) was measured as a function of the key experimental parameters to determine their optimal values for the Fourier transform mass spectrometry analysis of anionic glycosaminoglycan carbohydrates. These parameters include electron current, electron energy, dispenser cathode heater current, electron beam duration, charge state of the precursor ion, oligomer length, and precursor ion number accumulated in an external radio frequency multipole trap. Precursor conversion is most efficient at an electron current of 15 μA, and decreases at higher and lower values. The conversion of precursor to product ions increases in efficiency as the electron pulse duration is increased. Together, these data suggest that a radially repulsive electric field is produced between the electron beam and negative ions during EDD which causes the reaction cross-section to decrease at higher values of electron current (>15 μA). Elevating the heater current of the dispenser cathode increases the electron flux, but also causes ion activation, presumably by blackbody infrared irradiation. An electronic circuit is described that allows the electron current produced by the dispenser cathode to be measured during an EDD or electron capture dissociation (ECD) experiment.},

   abstract = {Many G-protein–coupled receptors belong to families of different receptor subtypes, which are recognized by a variety of distinct ligands. We summarize the current state of the art of the multireceptor/multiligand system of the so-called Y-receptor family. This family consists of four G-protein–coupled Y receptors in humans (hY1, hY2, hY4, and hY5) and is activated by the so-called neuropeptide Y hormone family, which consists of three native peptide ligands named neuropeptide Y, pancreatic polypeptide, and peptide YY. We recently reported that one conserved aspartate residue in the third extracellular loop is essential for ligand binding in all four Y receptors, but binds the endogenous ligands in a different mode by interacting with different ligand arginine residues. By combining peptide synthesis to obtain chemically modified neuropeptide Y, peptide YY, and pancreatic polypeptide analogs, receptor mutagenesis, and receptor chimeras, we could trace binding and signaling to a molecular level. The data on the variation of the ligands and an overview of the currently known mutagenesis data are summarized and specific models for the binding mode of the three ligands in all four receptors are provided.},

   abstract = {Catestatin is a 21-amino acid residue, cationic and hydrophobic peptide that is formed endogenously by proteolytic cleavage of its precursor chromogranin A, a major protein co-stored and co-released with catecholamines from the storage vesicles in adrenal chromaffin cells and adrenergic neurons. This peptide exhibits potent catecholamine release-inhibitory activity by acting on the neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor. It also stimulates histamine release from mast cells via heterotrimeric G-proteins in a receptor-independent manner. Plasma levels of catestatin are diminished not only in hypertensive patients but also in their still-normotensive offspring, indicating its role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. Consistently, exogenous catestatin rescues hypertension in chromogranin A knockout mice and diminishes blood pressure responses to activation of sympathetic outflow in rats. These hypotensive actions of catestatin may be caused directly by autocrine inhibition of catecholamine release from the sympathoadrenal system and indirectly by paracrine stimulation of the potent vasodilator histamine release from mast cells. Recently, three human variants of catestatin displaying differential potencies for inhibition of catecholamine secretion have been identified. One of these variants (Gly364Ser) causes increased baroreceptor sensitivity, increased cardiac parasympathetic activity, and decreased cardiac sympathetic activity, and it seems to alter the risk for hypertension. These cardiovascular effects may have resulted by action of this peptide in the baroreceptor centre of the nucleus tractus solitarius. Thus, accumulating evidence documents the endogenous peptide catestatin as a novel regulator of cardiac function and blood pressure.},

   abstract = {The nearly 600 proteases in the human genome regulate a diversity of biological processes, including programmed cell death. Comprehensive characterization of protease signaling in complex biological samples is limited by available proteomic methods. We have developed a general approach for global identification of proteolytic cleavage sites using an engineered enzyme to selectively biotinylate free protein N termini for positive enrichment of corresponding N-terminal peptides. Using this method to study apoptosis, we have sequenced 333 caspase-like cleavage sites distributed among 292 protein substrates. These sites are generally not predicted by in vitro caspase substrate specificity but can be used to predict other physiological caspase cleavage sites. Structural bioinformatic studies show that caspase cleavage sites often appear in surface-accessible loops and even occasionally in helical regions. Strikingly, we also find that a disproportionate number of caspase substrates physically interact, suggesting that these dimeric proteases target protein complexes and networks to elicit apoptosis.},

   abstract = {The vast majority of the proteins encoded in any genome naturally undergo a large number of different N-terminal modifications, hindering their characterization by routine proteomic approaches. These modifications are often irreversible, usually cotranslational and are crucial, as their occurrence may reflect or affect the status, fate and function of the protein. For example, large signal peptide cleavages and N-blocking mechanisms reflect targeting to various cell compartments, whereas N-ligation events tend to be related to protein half-life. N-terminal positional proteomic strategies hold promise as a new generation of approaches to the fine analysis of such modifications. However, further biological investigation is required to resolve problems associated with particular low-abundance or challenging N-terminal modifications. Recent progress in genomics and bioinformatics has provided us with a means of assessing the impact of these modifications in proteomes. This review focuses on methods for characterizing the occurrence and diversity of N-terminal modifications and for assessing their contribution to function in complete proteomes. Progress is being made towards the annotation of databases containing information for complete proteomes, and should facilitate research into all areas of proteomics.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: The myocardium secretes B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) in response to stimuli associated with heart failure (HF). However, high immunoreactive-BNP levels in patients with HF are associated with a paradoxical lack of natriuretic response. We hypothesized that commercially available assays for immunoreactive BNP do not reflect the bioactivity of the natriuretic peptide system, because they measure both unprocessed inactive pro-BNP and mature BNP 1-32. We describe an assay for the detection of bioactive BNP 1-32 and confirm very low concentrations in plasma from HF patients. METHODS AND RESULTS: We developed a quantitative mass spectrometry immunoassay to capture endogenous BNP peptides using high affinity antibodies. Bound BNP and its truncated fragments were detected by matrix assisted laser desorption ionization-time of flight mass spectrometry based on their predicted masses. Mass spectrometry immunoassay revealed rapid in vitro degradation of BNP 1-32 in plasma, which requires plasma collection in the presence of high protease inhibitor concentrations. In 11 of 12 HF patients BNP 1-32 was detectable, ranging from 25 to 43 pg/mL. Several degraded forms of BNP were also detected at similarly low levels. In contrast, parallel measurements of immunoreactive BNP using the Biosite assay ranged from 900 to 5000 pg/mL. CONCLUSIONS: Detection of endogenous BNP 1-32 requires special preservation of plasma samples. Mass spectrometry immunoassay technology demonstrates that HF patients have low levels of BNP 1-32. Commercially available immunoreactive-BNP assays overrepresent biological activity of the natriuretic peptide system because they cannot distinguish between active and inactive forms. This observation may, in part, explain the "natriuretic paradox."},

   abstract = {Seprase or Fibroblast Activation Protein (FAP) is an integral membrane serine peptidase, which has been shown to have gelatinase activity. Seprase has a dual function in tumour progression. The proteolytic activity of Seprase has been shown to promote cell invasiveness towards the ECM and also to support tumour growth and proliferation. Seprase appears to act as a proteolytically active 170-kDa dimer, consisting of two 97-kDa subunits. It is a member of the group type II integral serine proteases, which includes dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV/CD26) and related type II transmembrane prolyl serine peptidases, which exert their mechanisms of action on the cell surface. DPPIV and Seprase exhibit multiple functions due to their abilities to form complexes with each other and to interact with other membrane-associated molecules. Localisation of these protease complexes at cell surface protrusions, called invadopodia, may have a prominent role in processing soluble factors and in the degradation of extracellular matrix components that are essential to the cellular migration and matrix invasion that occur during tumour invasion, metastasis and angiogenesis.},

   abstract = {Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most frequent demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Peptidases like dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV, CD26) and aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) play a regulatory role in T cell activation and represent potential targets for the treatment of inflammatory disorders. Synthetic inhibitors of DP IV and/or APN enzymatic activity induce production of the immunosuppressive cytokine TGF-beta1 and subsequently suppress DNA synthesis and Th1 cytokine production of activated human T cells. Compelling evidence has demonstrated that IL-17-producing CD4 cells (Th17) are a major contributor to the pathogenesis of autoimmune inflammation. Here, we report that inhibitors of DP IV-like activity as well as of APN activity inhibit IL-17 production in activated human and mouse T cells. Combining inhibitors of DP IV and APN increases the suppressive effect on T cell specific IL-17 production in vitro compared to a single peptidase inhibitor. In the following, we summarize the evidence for the role of both ectoenzymes in T cell activation in vitro and in vivo and provide a rationale for the use of combined or dual ectopeptidase inhibitors to treat autoimmune diseases like MS.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) there is a progressive loss of beta-cell function. One new approach yielding promising results is the use of the orally active dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors. However, every new compound for T2DM has to prove long-term safety especially on cardiovascular outcomes. OBJECTIVES: Systematic review and meta-analysis of the effects of sitagliptin and vildagliptin therapy on main efficacy parameters and safety. SELECTION CRITERIA, DATA COLLECTION, AND ANALYSIS: Randomized controlled clinical studies of at least 12 weeks' duration in T2DM. RESULTS: DPP-4 inhibitors versus placebo showed glycosylated hemoglobin A1c (A1c) improvements of 0.7% versus placebo but not compared to monotherapy with other hypoglycemic agents (0.3% in favor of controls). The overall risk profile of DPP-4 inhibitors was low, however a 34% relative risk increase (95% confidence interval 10% to 64%, P = 0.004) was noted for all-cause infection associated with sitagliptin use. No data on immune function, health-related quality of life and diabetic complications could be extracted. CONCLUSIONS: DPP-4 inhibitors have some theoretical advantages over existing therapies with oral antidiabetic compounds but should currently be restricted to individual patients. Long-term data on cardiovascular outcomes and safety are needed before widespread use of these new agents.},

   abstract = {The information explosion in biology makes it difficult for researchers to stay abreast of current biomedical knowledge and to make sense of the massive amounts of online information. Ontologies--specifications of the entities, their attributes and relationships among the entities in a domain of discourse--are increasingly enabling biomedical researchers to accomplish these tasks. In fact, bio-ontologies are beginning to proliferate in step with accruing biological data. The myriad of ontologies being created enables researchers not only to solve some of the problems in handling the data explosion but also introduces new challenges. One of the key difficulties in realizing the full potential of ontologies in biomedical research is the isolation of various communities involved: some workers spend their career developing ontologies and ontology-related tools, while few researchers (biologists and physicians) know how ontologies can accelerate their research. The objective of this review is to give an overview of biomedical ontology in practical terms by providing a functional perspective--describing how bio-ontologies can and are being used. As biomedical scientists begin to recognize the many different ways ontologies enable biomedical research, they will drive the emergence of new computer applications that will help them exploit the wealth of research data now at their fingertips.},

Furthermore, the gene of the structural homologous DP10 represents a susceptibility locus for asthma in humans, and the functional homologous DP8/9 are expressed in human leukocytes. Thus, although several mechanisms may account for a role of DP4-like peptidases in asthma, detailed information on their anatomical sites of expression and function in lungs is lacking. Therefore, bronchi and lung parenchyma were evaluated using immunohistochemistry and histochemical/enzymatic activity assays, as well as quantitative real-time PCR for this family of peptidases in naive and asthmatic rat lungs derived from wild-type F344 and DP4-deficient F344 rat strains. Surprisingly, results show not only that the induction of experimental asthma increases DP4 enzymatic activity in the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and parenchyma, but also that DP8/9 enzymatic activity is regulated and, as well as the expression of DP10, primarily found in the bronchial epithelium of the airways. This is the first report showing a differential and site-specific DP4-like expression and function in the lungs, suggesting a pathophysiologically significant role in asthma.},

The development of new separation techniques, precise mass analyzers and experimental protocols is a very active field of research. This leads to more complex experimental setups yielding ever increasing amounts of data. Consequently, analysis of the data is currently often the bottleneck for experimental studies. Although software tools for many data analysis tasks are available today, they are often hard to combine with each other or not flexible enough to allow for rapid prototyping of a new analysis workflow. RESULTS: We present OpenMS, a software framework for rapid application development in mass spectrometry. OpenMS has been designed to be portable, easy-to-use and robust while offering a rich functionality ranging from basic data structures to sophisticated algorithms for data analysis. This has already been demonstrated in several studies. CONCLUSION: OpenMS is available under the Lesser GNU Public License (LGPL) from the project website at http://www.openms.de.},

   abstract = {Enhanced levels of expression of urokinase receptor (uPAR) and certain integrins have been linked to cancer cell progression. This has classically been attributed to matrix degradation via the activation of the urokinase (uPA)/plasmin system and modulation of cell motility and survival through integrin engagement. More recently, uPAR has been shown to play multiple roles independent of protease activity. Specifically, uPAR has been shown to be intimately involved in the regulation of cell adhesion, migration and proliferation in part through interactions with other membrane partners, including integrins. The goal of this review is to summarize recent insights in the function of uPAR/integrin interactions, to provide a framework for understanding the importance of these interactions in the context of cancer, and to highlight its potential as a target for therapeutic intervention.},

   abstract = {Significant morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes mellitus result largely from a greatly increased incidence of microvascular complications. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR) and end stage renal disease (ESRD) are two of the most common and severe microvascular complications of diabetes. A high concordance exists in the development of PDR and ESRD in diabetic patients, as well as strong familial aggregation of these complications, suggesting a common underlying genetic mechanism. However, the precise gene(s) and genetic variant(s) involved remain largely unknown. Erythropoietin (EPO) is a potent angiogenic factor observed in the diabetic human and mouse eye. By a combination of case-control association and functional studies, we demonstrate that the T allele of SNP rs1617640 in the promoter of the EPO gene is significantly associated with PDR and ESRD in three European-American cohorts [Utah: P = 1.91 x 10(-3); Genetics of Kidneys in Diabetes (GoKinD) Study: P = 2.66 x 10(-8); and Boston: P = 2.1 x 10(-2)]. The EPO concentration in human vitreous body was 7.5-fold higher in normal subjects with the TT risk genotype than in those with the GG genotype. Computational analysis suggests that the risk allele (T) of rs1617640 creates a matrix match with the EVI1/MEL1 or AP1 binding site, accounting for an observed 25-fold enhancement of luciferase reporter expression as compared with the G allele. These results suggest that rs1617640 in the EPO promoter is significantly associated with PDR and ESRD. This study identifies a disease risk-associated gene and potential pathway mediating severe diabetic microvascular complications.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is the member of Dipeptidyl Peptidase IV (DPIV) gene family that is most similar to DPIV. Four members of this family, DPIV, FAP, DP8 and DP9 possess a rare catalytic activity, hydrolysis of a prolyl bond two residues from the substrate N terminus. Crystal structures show that the soluble form of FAP comprises two domains, an alpha/beta-hydrolase domain and an 8-blade beta-propeller domain. The interface between these two domains forms the catalytic pocket, and an opening for substrate access to the internal active site. The FAP homodimer is structurally very similar to DPIV but FAP glycoprotein expression is largely confined to mesenchymal cells in diseased and damaged tissue, notably the tissue remodelling region in chronically injured liver. FAP peptide substrates include denatured collagen and alpha2-antiplasmin. The functional roles of FAP in tumors and fibrotic tissue are not fully understood. This review places FAP in the context of chronic liver injury pathogenesis.},

   abstract = {Electron detachment dissociation (EDD) Fourier transform mass spectrometry has recently been shown to be a useful method for tandem mass spectrometry analysis of sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). EDD produces abundant glycosidic and cross-ring fragmentations that are useful for localizing sites of sulfation in GAG oligosaccharides. Although EDD fragmentation can be used to characterize GAGs in a single tandem mass spectrometry experiment, SO3 loss accompanies many peaks and complicates the resulting mass spectra. In this work we demonstrate the ability to significantly decrease SO3 loss by selection of the proper ionized state of GAG precursor ions. When the degree of ionization is greater than the number of sulfate groups in an oligosaccharide, a significant reduction in SO3 loss is observed in the EDD mass spectra. These data suggested that SO3 loss is reduced when an electron is detached from carboxylate groups instead of sulfate. Electron detachment occurs preferentially from carboxylate versus sulfate for thermodynamic reasons, provided that carboxylate is in its ionized state. Ionization of the carboxylate group is achieved by selecting the appropriate precursor ion charge state, or by the replacement of protons with sodium cations. Increasing the ionization state by sodium cation addition decreases, but does not eliminate, SO3 loss from infrared multiphoton dissociation of the same GAG precursor ions.},

Examples of analytes that adsorb to this surface are small molecules, drugs, lipids, carbohydrates and peptides. Typically, NIMS is used to analyze samples ranging from simple analytical standards and proteolytic digests to more complex samples such as tissues, cells and biofluids. Critical experimental considerations of NIMS are described. Specifically, NIMS sensitivity is examined as a function of pre-etch cleaning treatment, etching current density, etching time, initiator composition, sample concentration, sample deposition method and laser fluence. Typically, NIMS surface preparation can be completed in less than 2 h. Subsequent sample preparation requires 1-5 min, depending on sample deposition method. Mass spectrometric data acquisition typically takes 1-30 s per sample.},

   abstract = {Histamine was intensively studied at the beginning of the 20th century because of its important role in allergic and inflammation processes. In those days it was very difficult that researchers could envisage another impacting function for the imidazolamine in the living systems. Once the imidazolamine was found located in neuron compartment in the brain, increasing evidence supported many regulatory functions including its possible role in memory and learning. The specific participation of histamine in cognitive functions followed a slow and unclear pathway because the many different experimental learning models, pharmacologic approaches, systemic and localized applications of the histamine active compounds into the brain used by researchers showed facilitating or inhibitory effects on learning, generating an active issue that has extended up to present time. In this review, all these aspects are analyzed and discussed considering the many intracellular different mechanisms discovered for histamine, the specific histamine receptors and the compartmentalizing proprieties of the brain that might explain the apparent inconsistent effects of the imidazolamine in learning. In addition, a hypothetical physiologic role for histamine in memory is proposed under the standard theories of learning in experimental animals and humans.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: In the past, different research groups could show that treatment of immune cells with inhibitors of post-proline splitting dipeptidyl aminopeptidases leads to functional changes in the immune system consistent with immunosuppression. This is due to the inhibition of proliferation of lymphocytes and the production of inflammatory cytokines of the TH1, TH2, and TH17, cells as well as the induction of immunosuppressive cytokines, such as transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and interleukin (IL)-1RA. Until recently, most of the effects of these inhibitors on immune functions were attributed to the inhibition of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase IV (DPIV/CD26). With the identification of new peptidases of the DPIV family (DASH) with the same or similar substrate specificity [fibroblast activation protein (FAP), DP8/9], the question arose whether and to what extent the inhibition of intracellularly localized enzymes, DP8 and DP9, contribute to the observed immunosuppression. In addition, members of the aminopeptidase N (APN) family are also involved in the regulation of immune functions. Hence, the concept of a combined targeting of both families of peptidases for treatment of inflammatory diseases is a promising strategy. RESULTS/CONCLUSIONS: Summarizing data obtained from the usage of different non-selective and selective inhibitors of DPIV, DP8/9, FAP, and DPII, this review provides evidence that in addition to DPIV, DP8/9 also regulate the immune response via modulation of cell cycle progression and cytokine production. The strongest and most consistent effects in vitro were, however, observed with non-selective inhibitors for the suppression of DNA synthesis and cytokine production. Similar effects were provoked by APN inhibitors, which were also found to suppress DNA synthesis and the production of inflammatory cytokines in vitro. However, different mechanisms and signaling pathways appear to mediate the cellular effects resulting from the inhibition of either APN or DPIV family members. In particular, members of the APN family uniquely influence the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T-cells. Consequently, the concomitant inhibition of both APN and DPIV enzyme families by means of two separate inhibitors or by binary inhibitors with specificity for both enzyme families (PETIR, peptidase targeted immunoregulation) synergistically affects immune cells on the level of cell cycle regulation, suppression of TH1, TH2, and TH17 cytokines as well as the activation of regulatory T-cells. Besides leukocytes, dermal cells as sebocytes, keratinocytes, and fibroblasts are also targeted by these inhibitors. This strongly suggests a broad potential of the multiple anti-inflammatory effects of PETIR in treatment of chronic inflammatory diseases, such as autoimmune diseases, allergies, and transplant rejections, as well as of inflammatory skin diseases, such as acne, psoriasis, rosacea or atopic dermatitis. The first active dual inhibitor, IP10.C8, has been developed by IMTM for the treatment of inflammatory skin diseases and has just entered the first phase II study.},

   abstract = {Motivation: Ever increasing amounts of biological interaction data are being accumulated worldwide, but they are currently not readily accessible to the biologist at a single site. New techniques are required for retrieving, sharing and presenting data spread over the Internet.Results: We introduce the DASMI system for the dynamic exchange, annotation and assessment of molecular interaction data. DASMI is based on the widely used Distributed Annotation System (DAS) and consists of a data exchange specification, web servers for providing the interaction data and clients for data integration and visualization. The decentralized architecture of DASMI affords the online retrieval of the most recent data from distributed sources and databases. DASMI can also be extended easily by adding new data sources and clients. We describe all DASMI components and demonstrate their use for protein and domain interactions.Availability: The DASMI tools are available at http://www.dasmi.de/ and http://ipfam.sanger.ac.uk/graph. The DAS registry and the DAS 1.53E specification is found at http://www.dasregistry.org/.Contact: mario.albrecht@mpi-inf.mpg.deSupplementary information: Supplementary data and all figures in color are available at Bioinformatics online.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV), assigned to the CD26 cluster, is expressed on epithelial cells and lymphocytes and is a multifunctional or pleiotropic protein. Its peptidase activity causes degradation of many biologically active peptides, e.g. some incretins secreted by the enteroendocrine system. DPP-IV has, therefore, become a novel therapeutic target for inhibitors that extend endogenously produced insulin half-life in diabetics, and several reviews have appeared in recent months concerning the clinical significance of CD26/DPP-IV. Biological fluids contain relatively high levels of soluble CD26 (sCD26). The physiological role of sCD26 and its relation, if any, to CD26 functions, remain poorly understood because whether the process for CD26 secretion and/or shedding from cell membranes is regulated or not is not known. Liver epithelium and lymphocytes are often cited as the most likely source of sCD26. It is important to establish which tissue or organ is the protein source as well as the circumstances that can provoke an abnormal presence/absence or altered levels in many diseases including cancer, so that sCD26 can be validated as a clinical marker or a therapeutic target. For example, we have previously reported low levels of sCD26 in the blood of colorectal cancer patients, which indicated the potential usefulness of the protein as a biomarker for this cancer in early diagnosis, monitoring and prognosis. Through this review, we envisage a role for sCD26 and the alteration of normal peptidase capacity (in clipping enteroendocrine or other peptides) in the complex crosstalk between the lymphoid lineage and, at least, some malignant tumours.},

   abstract = {The mRNA expression pattern of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP) 8 and DPP9, two DPP4 homologs, was studied previously and showed a broad tissue distribution. In this study, protein expression and activity of DPP8 and DPP9 were investigated in male reproductive tissues of different mammals. Based on specific DPP activities and inhibition profiles, the proline-selective DPP activity in the bovine and rat testis could predominantly be attributed to DPP8/9 and not to DPP4. This is in contrast to the epididymis, where most of the activity was caused by DPP4. Bovine sperm preparations had very low or undetectable DPP8/9 activity. After characterization of polyclonal antibodies specific for DPP8 or DPP9, we could localize both enzymes in seminiferous tubules of the testis. A specific staining for DPP9 was found associated with spermatozoids embedded in the epithelium, just before their release into the lumen, and in spermatids. DPP8 was localized in spermatozoids in an earlier stage of maturation. These findings help to provide insight into the physiological role of DPP4-like enzymes in the male reproductive system.

This has turned out to be a much more challenging question. In this review, we describe the multiple ways that mass spectrometry has attempted to address this issue, both for relative quantitation and for absolute quantitation of proteins. There is no single method that will work for every problem or for every sample. What we present here is a variety of techniques, with guidelines that we hope will assist the researcher in selecting the most appropriate technique for the particular biological problem that needs to be addressed. We need to emphasize that this is a very active area of proteomics research—new quantitative methods are continuously being introduced and some ‘pitfalls’ of older methods are just being discovered. However, even though there is no perfect technique—and a better technique may be developed tomorrow—valuable information on biomarkers and pathways can be obtained using these currently available methods Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Treatment of diabetes type 2 using chronic pharmacological inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DP4) still requires an in-depth analysis of models for chronic DP4 deficiency, because adverse reactions induced by some DP4 inhibitors have been described. METHODS: In the present study, a novel congenic rat model of DP4 deficiency on a "DP4-high" DA rat genetic background was generated (DA.F344-Dpp4(m)/ SvH rats) and comprehensively phenotyped. RESULTS: Similar to chronic pharmacological inhibition of DP4, DP4 deficient rats exhibited a phenotype involving reduced diet-induced body weight gain and improved glucose tolerance associated with increased levels of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and bound leptin as well as decreased aminotransferases and triglycerides. Additionally, DA.F344-Dpp4(m)/SvH rats showed anxiolytic-like and reduced stress-like responses, a phenomenon presently not targeted by DP4 inhibitors. However, several immune alterations, such as differential leukocyte subset composition at baseline, blunted natural killer cell and T-cell functions, and altered cytokine levels were observed. CONCLUSIONS: While this animal model confirms a critical role of DP4 in GLP-1-dependent glucose regulation, genetically induced chronic DP4 deficiency apparently also affects stress-regulatory and immuneregulatory systems, indicating that the use of chronic DP4 inhibitors might have the potential to interfere with central nervous system and immune functions in vivo.},

   abstract = {Protein degradation is an essential process that continuously takes place in all living cells. Regulated degradation of most cellular proteins is initiated by proteasomes, which produce peptides of varying length. These peptides are rapidly cleaved to single amino acids by cytoplasmic peptidases. Proline-containing peptides pose a specific problem due to structural constrains imposed by the pyrrolidine ring that prevents most peptidases from cleavage. Here we show that DPP9, a poorly characterized cytoplasmic prolyl-peptidase, is rate-limiting for destruction of proline-containing substrates both in cell extracts and in intact cells. We identified the first natural substrate for DPP9, the RU1(34-42) antigenic peptide (VPYGSFKHV). RU1(34-42) is degraded in vitro by DPP9, and down-regulation of DPP9 in intact cells results in increased presentation of this antigen. Together our findings demonstrate an important role for DPP9 in peptide turnover and antigen presentation.},

   abstract = {Modern soft ionization techniques readily produce protonated or multiply protonated peptides. Collision-induced dissociation (CID) of these protonated species is often used as a method to obtain sequence information. In many cases fragmentation occurs at amide bonds. When the charge resides on the C-terminal fragment so-called y ions are produced which are known to be protonated amino acids or truncated peptides. When the charge resides on the N-terminal fragment so-called b ions are produced. Often the sequence of y and b ions are essential for peptide sequencing. The b ions have many possible structures, a knowledge of which is useful in this sequencing. The structures of b ions are reviewed in the following with particular emphasis on the variation of structure with the number of amino acid residues in the b ion and the effect of peptide side chain on b ion structure.

   abstract = {The Proteolysis MAP (PMAP, http://www.proteolysis.org) is a user-friendly website intended to aid the scientific community in reasoning about proteolytic networks and pathways. PMAP is comprised of five databases, linked together in one environment. The foundation databases, ProteaseDB and SubstrateDB, are driven by an automated annotation pipeline that generates dynamic 'Molecule Pages', rich in molecular information. PMAP also contains two community annotated databases focused on function; CutDB has information on more than 5000 proteolytic events, and ProfileDB is dedicated to information of the substrate recognition specificity of proteases. Together, the content within these four databases will ultimately feed PathwayDB, which will be comprised of known pathways whose function can be dynamically modeled in a rule-based manner, and hypothetical pathways suggested by semi-automated culling of the literature. A Protease Toolkit is also available for the analysis of proteases and proteolysis. Here, we describe how the databases of PMAP can be used to foster understanding of proteolytic pathways, and equally as significant, to reason about proteolysis.},

   abstract = {DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) degrades the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide), decreasing their stimulatory effects on beta-cell insulin secretion. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, meal-related GLP-1 secretion is reduced. DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) correct the GLP-1 deficiency by blocking this degradation, prolonging the incretin effect and enhancing glucose homoeostasis. DPP-4 is a member of a family of ubiquitous atypical serine proteases with many physiological functions beyond incretin degradation, including effects on the endocrine and immune systems. The role of DPP-4 on the immune system relates to its extra-enzymatic activities. The intracytosolic enzymes DPP-8 and DPP-9 are recently discovered DPP-4 family members. Although specific functions of DPP-8 and DPP-9 are unclear, a potential for adverse effects associated with DPP-8 and DPP-9 inhibition by non-selective DPP inhibitors has been posed based on a single adverse preclinical study. However, the preponderance of data suggests that such DPP-8 and DPP-9 enzyme inhibition is probably without clinical consequence. This review examines the structure and function of the DPP-4 family, associated DPP-4 inhibitor selectivity and the implications of DPP-4 inhibition in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.},

Just a small number of proline-specific hydrolases including dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) and related molecules is capable of cleaving such post-prolyl bond. DPP-IV, originally described on the basis of its enzymatic activity, is a ubiquitous, multifunctional homodimeric plasma membrane glycoprotein of type II. Subsequently, several other molecules related to DPP-IV by their enzymatic activity and/or sequence were discovered and classified as "dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity and/or structure homologues" (DASH). Along with canonical DPP-IV this group comprises DPP-IVbeta, DPP-II, DPP6, DPP8, DPP9, DPP10 and fibroblast activation protein alpha (FAP-alpha). Recent observations of deregulated expression of several DASH molecules in multiple human cancers led to the assumptions of their pathogenetic relevance in cancerogenesis. Here we review recent information about selected DASH molecules in human malignancies.},

   abstract = {Circulating antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme (APCE), a prolyl-specific serine proteinase, is essentially identical to membrane-inserted fibroblast activation protein (FAP) that is transiently expressed during epithelial-derived cancer growth. Human precursive alpha(2)-antiplasmin (Met-alpha(2)AP), the only known physiologic substrate for APCE, is cleaved N-terminally to Asn-alpha(2)AP that is rapidly cross-linked to fibrin and protects it from digestion by plasmin. Identifying a specific inhibitor of APCE/FAP continues to be intensely pursued. Recombinant FAP cleavage of peptide libraries of short amino acid sequences surrounding the scissile bond, -Pro(12)-Asn(13)-, indicated that P2 Gly and P1 Pro are required, just as we found for APCE. We examined cleavage of P4-P4' peptides, using 19 amino acid substitutions at each position and selected ones in P8-P5. K(m) values determined for peptide substrates showed that P7 Arg has the highest affinity for APCE. Peptide cleavage rate increased with Arg in P6 rather than P5 or native P7. Placing Arg in P4 or P8 reduced cleavage rates dramatically. Cleavage of substrates with extended peptide sequences before or after the scissile bond showed endopeptidase to be superior to dipeptidase activity for APCE. A substrate analogue inhibitor, Phe-Arg-(8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid)-Gly-[r]-fluoropyrrolidide, inhibited APCE with a K(i) of 54 microM but not dipeptidyl peptidase IV even at 2 mM. The inhibitor also blocked cleavage of Met-alpha(2)AP with an IC(50) of 91 microM. Replacing Arg with Gly at the same distance from fluoropyrrolidide as P7 Arg is from P1 Pro reduced its inhibition of APCE approximately 10-fold. Results indicate that Arg at P5, P6, or P7 distances from P1 enhances affinity and efficiency of substrates or inhibitors toward APCE or FAP.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) or adenosine deaminase complexing protein 2 (ADCP 2) or T-cell activation antigen CD26 (EC 3.4.14.5.) is a serine exopeptidase belonging to the S9B protein family that cleaves X-proline dipeptides from the N-terminus of polypeptides, such as chemokines, neuropeptides, and peptide hormones. The enzyme is a type II transmembrane glycoprotein, expressed on the surface of many cell types, whose physiological functions are largely unknown. Protein dimerisation should be required for catalytic activity and glycosylation of the enzyme could impact on its physiological functions. The dimeric glycoprotein ADCP has been found linked to adenosine deaminase (ADA) whose relationship with lymphocyte maturation-differentiation is well-established. <br xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"></br> Since implicated in the regulation of the biological activity of hormones and chemokines, such as glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, DPP4 inhibition offers a new potential therapeutic approach for type 2 diabetes mellitus, as monotherapy and adjunct therapy to other oral agents. The clinical use of presently available orally active inhibitors of DPP4, however, has been associated with side effects that have been in part attributed to the inhibition of related serine proteases, such as DPP8 and DPP9. Indeed, it is noteworthy that CD26 has a key role in immune regulation as a T cell activation molecule and in immune-mediated disorder. All-cause infections were increased after sitagliptin treatment. It is noteworthy that the effects of DPP4 inhibition on the immune system have not been extensively investigated. So far, only routine laboratory safety variables have been measured in published randomised controlled trials. <br xmlns="http://pub2web.metastore.ingenta.com/ns/"></br> The review summarises present knowledge in the field and suggests some potential directions of future research.},

   pages = {1866-1873},
   abstract = {Enterostatin is a peptide that regulates dietary fat intake in rodents and inhibits insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells. Microarray studies of the genomic response of both a human hepatoma cell line (HepG2 cells) and a mouse hypothalamic cell line (GT1-7 cells) to enterostatin suggested that it might regulate protein trafficking. Using semi-quantitative real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we confirmed that enterostatin upregulated Scamp2 and down regulated Dynamin2 in these cell lines. The receptor for enterostatin is the F1-ATPase beta subunit. We transfected HepG2 cells with either a green fluorescent protein (GFP) tagged F1-ATPase beta subunit or a red fluorescent protein (RFP) tagged F1-ATPase alpha subunit to study the effects of enterostatin on translocation of its own receptor protein. Enterostatin induced movement of GFP-beta subunit to the cell periphery area but did not have any effect on the localization of RFP-alpha subunit protein in HepG2. As Scamp2 is involved in glucose uptake in mouse Beta-TC6 insulinoma cells we tested enterostatin's effect in Beta-TC6 cells. Glucose stimulated insulin release was inhibited by enterostatin as reported previously. Using siRNA to Scamp2 did not change glucose stimulated insulin release but siRNA to Dynamin2 and dominant negative Dynamin2 (Dyn K44A) inhibited glucose stimulated insulin release and abolished the response to enterostatin. This suggests enterostatin inhibits glucose stimulated insulin release in pancreatic beta cells through down regulation of Dynamin2. This study also suggests that enterostatin might have a more generalized effect on protein trafficking in various cells.},

DPIV family members have diverse biological roles, and have been implicated in a range of diseases including diabetes, cancer, inflammatory bowel disease, multiple sclerosis (MS), arthritis and asthma. While DP8/9 biological functions are yet to be established, they have been predicted to have similar roles to the other DPs due to high sequence similarities within the active site of the enzymes. While there is mounting evidence towards the involvement of DP8 and/or DP9 in innate and acquired immunity, direct proof for the link between DP8 and DP9 and human disease is yet to be definitively shown, thus DP8 and 9 proteins remain guilty by association.},

The recent availability of whole genomic sequences from multiple organisms has led us to predict the contents of the degradomes of several mammalian species. To ensure the fidelity of these predictions, our methods have included manual curation of individual sequences and, when necessary, direct cloning and sequencing experiments. The results of these studies in human, chimpanzee, mouse and rat have been incorporated into the Degradome database, which can be accessed through a web interface at http://degradome.uniovi.es. The annotations about each individual protease can be retrieved by browsing catalytic classes and families or by searching specific terms. This web site also provides detailed information about genetic diseases of proteolysis, a growing field of great importance for multiple users. Finally, the user can find additional information about protease structures, protease inhibitors, ancillary domains of proteases and differences between mammalian degradomes.},

   abstract = {Peptidases are enzymes that hydrolyse peptide bonds in proteins and peptides. Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as 'physiological' is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases.Database URL:http://merops.sanger.ac.uk.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DP IV, CD26) and DP IV-like enzymes, such as dipeptidyl peptidase II (DP II), dipeptidyl peptidase 8 (DP8), and dipeptidyl peptidase 9 (DP9), have been recognized to regulate T lymphocyte activation. Lys[Z(NO2)]-thiazolidide (LZNT) and Lys[Z(NO2)]-pyrrolidide (LZNP), non-selective inhibitors of DP IV-like activity known to target DP IV as well as DP II, DP8, and DP9, suppress T lymphocyte proliferation in vitro. Moreover, these inhibitors are capable of attenuating the severity of autoimmune diseases, such as experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, the animal model of multiple sclerosis, and experimental arthritis, a model of human rheumatoid arthritis, in vivo, particularly in combination with inhibitors of aminopeptidase N (APN, CD13) enzymatic activity. METHODS: Here, we studied the influence of non-selective and selective inhibitors of DP IV-like enzymes on DNA synthesis in mitogen-stimulated splenocytes from wild-type C57BL/6 mice and DP IV/CD26-knockout (DP IV/CD26-KO) mice. RESULTS: LZNT and LZNP, the non-selective inhibitors of DP IV-like activity, suppressed the DNA synthesis in stimulated splenocytes from wild-type and DP IV/ CD26-KO mice to a comparable extent. Further, a selective inhibitor of DP8/DP9 activity was capable of suppressing DNA synthesis in mitogen-stimulated splenocytes of both wild-type and knockout mice to the same extent. In contrast, selective inhibitors of DP IV and DP II lacked this suppressive activity. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support the hypothesis that DP8 and/or DP9 represent additional pharmacological targets for the suppression of T cell proliferation and for anti-inflammatory therapy.},

The cattle genome contains a minimum of 22,000 genes, with a core set of 14,345 orthologs shared among seven mammalian species of which 1217 are absent or undetected in noneutherian (marsupial or monotreme) genomes. Cattle-specific evolutionary breakpoint regions in chromosomes have a higher density of segmental duplications, enrichment of repetitive elements, and species-specific variations in genes associated with lactation and immune responsiveness. Genes involved in metabolism are generally highly conserved, although five metabolic genes are deleted or extensively diverged from their human orthologs. The cattle genome sequence thus provides a resource for understanding mammalian evolution and accelerating livestock genetic improvement for milk and meat production.},

Moreover, the dimer interaction mode was investigated by introducing a mutation (F842A) at the dimer interface, which abolished the enzymatic activity without disrupting its quaternary structure. Furthermore, DPP9 was found ubiquitously expressed in fibroblasts, epithelial, and blood cells. Surprisingly, contrary to previous report, we found that the expression levels of DPP8 and DPP9 did not change upon the activation of the PBMC or Jurkat cells. These results indicate that the biochemical property of DPP9 is very similar to that of DPP8, its homologous protease. DPP9 and DPP8 are likely redundant proteins carrying out overlapping functions in vivo.},

   abstract = {The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) system (uPAS) consists of the uPA, its cognate receptor (uPAR) and two specific inhibitors, the plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) and 2 (PAI-2). The uPA converts the proenzyme plasminogen in the serine protease plasmin, involved in a number of physiopathological processes requiring basement membrane (BM) and/or extracellular matrix (ECM) remodelling, including tumor progression and metastasis. Data accumulated over the past years have made increasingly clear that the uPAS has a multifunctional task in the neoplastic evolution, affecting tumor angiogenesis, malignant cell proliferation, adhesion and migration, intravasation and growth at the metastatic site. In agreement with their role in cancer progression and metastasis, an increased expression of uPA, uPAR, and PAI-1 has been documented in several malignant tumors, and a positive correlation between the levels of one or more uPAS members and a poor prognosis has been frequently reported. This is particularly evident in breast cancer, for which uPA has been demonstrated to be the most potent independent prognostic factor described to date. The involvement of the uPAS in cancer progression identifies its components as suitable targets for anti-cancer therapy. Several therapeutical approaches aimed at inhibiting the uPA/uPAR functions have been shown to possess anti-tumor effects in xenograft models, including selective inhibitors of uPA activity, antagonist peptides, monoclonal antibodies able to prevent uPA binding to uPAR and gene therapy techniques silencing uPA/uPAR expression. All these strategies, however, although promising, need definitive confirmation in humans as, up to now, only few uPA inhibitors entered clinical trial.},

   abstract = {Pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) is a 38-amino acid C-terminally alpha-amidated peptide that was first isolated 20 years ago from an ovine hypothalamic extract on the basis of its ability to stimulate cAMP formation in anterior pituitary cells (Miyata et al., 1989. PACAP belongs to the vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP)-secretin-growth hormone-releasing hormone-glucagon superfamily. The sequence of PACAP has been remarkably well conserved during evolution from protochordates to mammals, suggesting that PACAP is involved in the regulation of important biological functions. PACAP is widely distributed in the brain and peripheral organs, notably in the endocrine pancreas, gonads, respiratory and urogenital tracts. Characterization of the PACAP precursor has revealed the existence of a PACAP-related peptide, the activity of which remains unknown. Two types of PACAP binding sites have been characterized: type I binding sites exhibit a high affinity for PACAP and a much lower affinity for VIP, whereas type II binding sites have similar affinity for PACAP and VIP. Molecular cloning of PACAP receptors has shown the existence of three distinct receptor subtypes: the PACAP-specific PAC1-R, which is coupled to several transduction systems, and the PACAP/VIP-indifferent VPAC1-R and VPAC2-R, which are primarily coupled to adenylyl cyclase. PAC1-Rs are particularly abundant in the brain, the pituitary and the adrenal gland, whereas VPAC receptors are expressed mainly in lung, liver, and testis. The development of transgenic animal models and specific PACAP receptor ligands has strongly contributed to deciphering the various actions of PACAP. Consistent with the wide distribution of PACAP and its receptors, the peptide has now been shown to exert a large array of pharmacological effects and biological functions. The present report reviews the current knowledge concerning the pleiotropic actions of PACAP and discusses its possible use for future therapeutic applications.},

Here, we compare existing prediction tools with SitePrediction, a novel and user-friendly tool for identifying potential cleavage sites. This prediction is based on known datasets found in the literature, stored in web-accessible repositories or generated by our own experiments. Comparison of the different programs shows that SitePrediction makes it possible to derive more reliable predictions. In addition, this tool allows the use of a wide range of proteinases.},

   abstract = {Some mutations resulting in protein sequence change might be tightly related to certain human diseases by affecting its roles, such as sickle cell anemia. Until now several databases, such as PMD, OMIM and HGMD, have been developed, providing useful information about human disease-related mutation. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS) has been used for characterizing proteins in various conditions; however, there is no system in place for finding disease-related mutated proteins within the MS results. Here, a Systematical Platform for Identifying Mutated Proteins (SysPIMP; http://pimp.starflr.info/) was developed to efficiently identify human disease-related mutated proteins within MS results. SysPIMP comprises of three layers: (i) a standardized data warehouse, (ii) a pipeline layer for maintaining human disease databases and X!Tandem and BLAST and (iii) a web-based interface. From OMIM AV part, PMD and SwissProt databases, 35 497 non-redundant human disease-related mutated sequences were collected with disease information described by OMIM terms. With the interfaces to browse sequences archived in SysPIMP, X!Tandem, an open source database-search engine used to identify proteins within MS data, was integrated into SysPIMP to help support the detection of potential human disease-related mutants in MS results. In addition, together with non-redundant disease-related mutated sequences, original non-mutated sequences are also provided in SysPIMP for comparative research. Based on this system, SysPIMP will be the platform for efficiently and intensively studying human diseases caused by mutation.},

Its application to xenobiotics and endogenous metabolites in tissues is demonstrated, where clozapine and N-desmethylclozapine were observed from mouse and rat brain sections. It has also been applied to direct biofluid analysis where ketamine and norketamine were observed from plasma and urine. Detection of xenobiotics from biofluids was made even more effective using a novel NIMS on-surface extraction method taking advantage of the hydrophobic nature of the initiator. Linear response and limit of detection were also evaluated for xenobiotics such as methamphetamine, codeine, alprazolam, and morphine, revealing that NIMS can be used for quantitative analysis. Overall, our results demonstrate the capacity of NIMS to perform sensitive, simple, and rapid analyses from highly complex biological tissues and fluids.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-4 is a member of the S9b serine protease family, which also includes DPP8 and DPP9. DPP4 cleaves a number of regulatory factors, including chemokines and growth factors. DPP4 inhibitors have recently emerged as an effective treatment option for type 2 diabetes. Early in vitro studies demonstrated that DPP4 inhibitors inhibit T-cell proliferation and cytokine production, leading to their investigation in numerous pre-clinical models of inflammatory diseases, including arthritis, multiple sclerosis and inflammatory bowel disease. Recent data suggest that the early DPP4-specific inhibitors might also bind DPP8 and DPP9, thus exerting their effects through non-specific binding. This review highlights recent insights into the applicability of DPP inhibitors as novel pharmacological agents for inflammatory disease.},

Glucagon-like peptide-2 (GLP-2) is a potent and specific gastrointestinal growth factor that is demonstrating therapeutic potential for the prevention or treatment of an expanding number of intestinal diseases, including short bowel syndrome (SBS), small bowel enteritis and IBD. The biological activity of GLP-2 is limited due to proteolytic inactivation by the protease dipeptidyl peptidase (DP)IV. Inhibitors of DPIV activity may represent a novel strategy to prolong the growth promoting actions of GLP-2.

   abstract = {The dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) enzyme family contains both potential and proven therapeutic targets. Recent reports indicate the presence of DP8 and DP9 in peripheral blood lymphocytes, testis, lung, and brain. For a more comprehensive understanding of DP8 and DP9 tissue and cellular expression, mRNA and enzyme activity were examined. Many organs from C57BL/6 wild-type and DPIV gene-knockout mice were examined; DP8/9 enzyme activity was detected in the immune system, brain, testis, muscle, and epithelia. In situ hybridization localized DP8 and DP9 mRNA to lymphocytes and epithelial cells in liver, gastrointestinal tract, lymph node, spleen, and lung. DP8 and DP9 mRNA was detected in baboon and mouse testis, and DP9 expression was elevated in human testicular cancers. DP8 and DP9 mRNA were ubiquitous in day 17 mouse embryo, with greatest expression in epithelium (skin and gastrointestinal tract) and brain. Thus, DP8 and DP9 are widely expressed enzymes. Their expression in lymphocytes and epithelia indicates potential for roles in the digestive and immune systems. This manuscript contains online supplemental material at http://www.jhc.org.

   abstract = {Since its discovery at the beginning of the 20th century, histamine has been established to play a pathophysiological regulatory role in cellular events through binding to four types of G-protein-coupled histamine receptors that are differentially expressed in various cell types. The discovery, at the turn of the millennium, that the histamine H4 receptor is largely expressed in haemopoietic cells as well as its chemotactic properties designate its regulatory role in the immune system. H4 receptors modulate eosinophil migration and selective recruitment of mast cells leading to amplification of histamine-mediated immune responses and eventually to chronic inflammation. H4 receptor involvement in dendritic cell activation and T cell differentiation documents its immunomodulatory function. The characterization of the H4 as the immune system histamine receptor directed growing attention towards its therapeutic exploitation in inflammatory disorders, such as allergy, asthma, chronic pruritus and autoimmune diseases. The efficacy of a number of H4 receptor ligands has been evaluated in in vivo and in vitro animal models of disease and in human biological samples. However, before reaching decisive conclusions on H4 receptor pathophysiological functions and therapeutic exploitation, identification of genetic polymorphisms and interspecies differences in its relative actions and pharmacological profile need to be addressed and taken into consideration. Despite certain variations in the reported findings, the available data strongly point to the H4 receptor as a novel target for the pharmacological modulation of histamine-transferred immune signals and offer an optimistic perspective for the therapeutic exploitation of this promising new drug target in inflammatory disorders.},

   abstract = {AIM: To examine the effects of 12 weeks of treatment with the DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, on gastrointestinal hormone responses to a standardized mixed meal and beta cell secretory capacity, measured as glucose and non-glucose induced insulin secretion during a hyperglycaemic clamp, in patients with type 2 diabetes. METHOD: A double-blinded, placebo-controlled study over 12 weeks in which 24 patients with T2DM were randomized to receive either sitagliptin (Januvia) 100 mg qd or placebo as an add-on therapy to metformin. In week 0, 1 and 12 patients underwent a meal test and a 90-min 20 mM hyperglycaemic clamp with 5 g of l-arginine infusion. Main outcome measure was postprandial total glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) concentration. Additional measures were insulin and C-peptide, glycaemic control, intact and total peptide YY (PYY) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP), and intact glucagon-like peptide 2 (GLP-2) and GLP-1. RESULTS: All patients [sitagliptin n = 12, age: 59.5 (39-64) years, HbA1c: 8.0 (7.3-10.0)%, BMI: 33.2 (29.3-39.4); placebo n = 12, age: 60 (31-72) years, HbA1c: 7.7 (7.1-9.8)%, BMI: 30.7 (25.7-40.5)] [median (range)] completed the trial. Sitagliptin treatment improved glycaemic control, had no effect on total GLP-1, GIP or intact GLP-2, but reduced total PYY and PYY(3- 36), and increased PYY(1- 36) and intact incretin hormones. Sitagliptin improved first and second phases of beta cell secretion and maximal secretory capacity. All effects were achieved after 1 week. No significant changes occurred in the placebo group. CONCLUSION: The postprandial responses of total GLP-1 and GIP and intact GLP-2 were unaltered. PYY degradation was prevented. Glucose and non-glucose induced beta cell secretion was improved. There was no difference in responses to sitagliptin between 1 and 12 weeks of treatment.},

   abstract = {Proteolysis constitutes a major post-translational modification but specificity and substrate selectivity of numerous proteases have remained elusive. In this review, we highlight how advanced techniques in the areas of proteomics and activity-based probes can be used to investigate i) protease active site specificity; ii) protease in vivo substrates; iii) protease contribution to proteome homeostasis and composition; and iv) detection and localization of active proteases. Peptide libraries together with genetical or biochemical selection have traditionally been used for active site profiling of proteases. These are now complemented by proteome-derived peptide libraries that simultaneously determine prime and non-prime specificity and characterize subsite cooperativity. Cell-contextual discovery of protease substrates is rendered possible by techniques that isolate and quantitate protein termini. Here, a novel approach termed Terminal Amine Isotopic Labeling of Substrates (TAILS) provides an integrated platform for substrate discovery and appropriate statistical evaluation of terminal peptide identification and quantification. Proteolytically generated carboxy-termini can now also be analyzed on a proteome-wide level. Proteolytic regulation of proteome composition is monitored by quantitative proteomic approaches employing stable isotope coding or label free quantification. Activity-based probes specifically recognize active proteases. In proteomic screens, they can be used to detect and quantitate proteolytic activity while their application in cellular histology allows to locate proteolytic activity in situ. Activity-based probes - especially in conjunction with positron emission tomography - are also promising tools to monitor proteolytic activities on an organism-wide basis with a focus on in vivo tumor imaging. Together, this array of methodological possibilities enables unveiling physiological protease substrate repertoires and defining protease function in the cellular- and organism-wide context.},

We report fifteen sitagliptin intolerant patients who developed anterior and posterior rhinorrhea, cough, dyspnea, and fatigue. Symptoms typically developed within 1 to 8 weeks of starting, and resolved within 1 week of stopping the drug. Peak expiratory flow rates increased 34% in 8 patients who stopped sitagliptin. Similar changes were found in 4 out of 5 persons who had confirmatory readministration. Chart review identified 17 patients who tolerated sitagliptin and had no symptomatic changes. The sitagliptin intolerant group had higher rates of clinically diagnosed allergic rhinitis (15/15 vs. 6/18; p = 0.00005), Fisher's Exact test) and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor - induced cough (6/13 vs. 1/18; p = 0.012). Nasal and inhaled glucocorticoids may control the underlying allergic inflammation and abrogate this new sitagliptin - induced pharmacological syndrome. Potential mucosal and central nervous system mechanisms include disruption of neuropeptides and/or cytokines that rely on DPP IV for activation or inactivation, and T cell dysfunction.},

   abstract = {Motivation:Granzyme B (GrB) and caspases cleave specific protein substrates to induce apoptosis in virally infected and neoplastic cells. While substrates for both types of proteases have been determined experimentally, there are many more yet to be discovered in humans and other metazoans. Here, we present a bioinformatics method based on support vector machine (SVM) learning that identifies sequence and structural features important for protease recognition of substrate peptides and then uses these features to predict novel substrates. Our approach can act as a convenient hypothesis generator, guiding future experiments by high-confidence identification of peptide-protein partners.Results:The method is benchmarked on the known substrates of both protease types, including our literature-curated GrB substrate set (GrBah). On these benchmark sets, the method outperforms a number of other methods that consider sequence only, predicting at a 0.87 true positive rate (TPR) and a 0.13 false positive rate (FPR) for caspase substrates, and a 0.79 TPR and a 0.21 FPR for GrB substrates. The method is then applied to ∼25 000 proteins in the human proteome to generate a ranked list of predicted substrates of each protease type. Two of these predictions, AIF-1 and SMN1, were selected for further experimental analysis, and each was validated as a GrB substrate.Availability: All predictions for both protease types are publically available at http://salilab.org/peptide. A web server is at the same site that allows a user to train new SVM models to make predictions for any protein that recognizes specific oligopeptide ligands.Contact: craik@cgl.ucsf.edu; sali@salilab.orgSupplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online},

   abstract = {Liraglutide is a glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) analog developed for type 2 diabetes. Long-term liraglutide exposure in rodents was associated with thyroid C-cell hyperplasia and tumors. Here, we report data supporting a GLP-1 receptor-mediated mechanism for these changes in rodents. The GLP-1 receptor was localized to rodent C-cells. GLP-1 receptor agonists stimulated calcitonin release, up-regulation of calcitonin gene expression, and subsequently C-cell hyperplasia in rats and, to a lesser extent, in mice. In contrast, humans and/or cynomolgus monkeys had low GLP-1 receptor expression in thyroid C-cells, and GLP-1 receptor agonists did not activate adenylate cyclase or generate calcitonin release in primates. Moreover, 20 months of liraglutide treatment (at >60 times human exposure levels) did not lead to C-cell hyperplasia in monkeys. Mean calcitonin levels in patients exposed to liraglutide for 2 yr remained at the lower end of the normal range, and there was no difference in the proportion of patients with calcitonin levels increasing above the clinically relevant cutoff level of 20 pg/ml. Our findings delineate important species-specific differences in GLP-1 receptor expression and action in the thyroid. Nevertheless, the long-term consequences of sustained GLP-1 receptor activation in the human thyroid remain unknown and merit further investigation.},

   abstract = {Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is widely distributed in the human body and contributes to a vast number of physiological processes. Since its discovery, NPY has been implicated in metabolic regulation and, although interest in its role in central mechanisms related to food intake and obesity has somewhat diminished, the topic remains a strong focus of research concerning NPY signalling. In addition, a number of other uses for modulators of NPY receptors have been implied in a range of diseases, although the development of NPY receptor ligands has been slow, with no clinically approved receptor therapeutics currently available. Nevertheless, several interesting small molecule compounds, notably Y2 receptor antagonists, have been published recently, fueling optimism in the field. Herein we review the role of NPY in the pathophysiology of a number of diseases and highlight instances where NPY receptor signalling systems are attractive therapeutic targets.},

The development of proteomics has rapidly changed the knowledge on urine protein composition and probably will modify it again. Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2D-PAGE) coupled with mass spectrometry has represented for years the technique of choice for the analysis of urine proteins and it is time to draw some conclusions. This review will focus on major methodological aspects related to urine sample collection, storage and analysis by 2D-PAGE and attempt to define an advanced normal urine protein map. Overall, 1118 spots were reproducibly found in normal urine samples but only 275 were characterized as isoforms of 82 proteins. One-hundred height spots belonging to 30 proteins were also detected in plasma and corresponded to typical plasma components. The identity of most of the proteins found in normal urine by 2D-PAGE remains to be determined, the majority being low-molecular weight proteins (&lt; 30 kDa). Equalization procedures would also enhance sensitivity of the analysis and allow low abundance proteins to be characterized. Therefore, we are still on the way to define the normal urine composition. Technology advancements in concentrating procedure will improve sensitivity and give the possibility to purify proteins for mass spectrometry.},

   abstract = {Morphiceptin (Tyr-Pro-Phe-Pro-NH2), a tetrapeptide present in the enzymatic digest of bovine β-casein, is a selective ligand of the μ-opioid receptor. In the present study, we describe the synthesis of a series of novel morphiceptin analogs modified in positions 1–3. Two of the obtained analogs, [Dmt1, d-Ala2, d-1-Nal3]morphiceptin and [Dmt1, d-NMeAla2, d-1-Nal3]morphiceptin (Dmt—2′,6′-dimethyltyrosine and d-1-Nal—3-(1-naphthyl)-d-alanine)) displayed very high μ-receptor affinity, resistance to enzymatic degradation, and remarkable supraspinally mediated analgesia, as shown in the hot-plate test after intracerebroventricular but not intravenous administration, which indicated that they could not cross the blood–brain barrier. Therefore, these two analogs were further tested in vitro and in vivo towards their possible peripheral analgesic activity and inhibitory effect on gastrointestinal (GI) motility. We report that both peptides showed strong antinociceptive effect in the writhing test after intraperitoneal administration, inhibited smooth muscle contractility in vitro and GI motility in vivo. Taken together, these findings indicate that the novel morphiceptin analogs which induce peripheral, but not central antinociception, inhibit GI transit, and possess exceptional metabolic stability, may provide an interesting approach to the development of peripherally restricted agents for the treatment of GI motility disorders, such as diarrhea or diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome.},

GelML supports the capture of metadata (such as experimental protocols) and data (such as gel images) resulting from gel electrophoresis so that laboratories can be compliant with the MIAPE Gel Electrophoresis guidelines, while allowing such data sets to be exchanged or downloaded from public repositories. The format is sufficiently flexible to capture data from a broad range of experimental processes, and complements other PSI formats for MS data and the results of protein and peptide identifications to capture entire gel-based proteome workflows. GelML has resulted from the open standardisation process of PSI consisting of both public consultation and anonymous review of the specifications.},

   abstract = {Although trypsin remains the most commonly used protease in MS, other proteases may be employed for increasing peptide coverage or generating overlapping peptides. Knowledge of the accurate specificity rules of these proteases is helpful for database search tools to detect peptides, and becomes crucial when label-free MS is used to discover in vivo proteolytic cleavages. Since in vivo cleavages are inferred by subtracting digestion-induced cleavages from all observed cleavages, it is important to ensure that the specificity rule used to identify digestion-induced cleavages are broad enough to capture even minor cleavages produced in digestion, to avoid erroneously identifying them as in vivo cleavages. In this study, we describe MS-Proteolysis, a software tool for identifying putative sites of in vivo proteolytic cleavage using label-free MS. The tool is used in conjunction with digestion by trypsin and three other proteases, whose specificity rules are revised and extended before inferring proteolytic cleavages. Finally, we show that comparative analysis of multiple proteases can be used to detect putative in vivo proteolytic sites on a proteome-wide scale.},

Histamine [2-(4-imidazole) ethylamine] is a ubiquitous inflammatory mediator of diverse physiological processes including neurotransmission, secretion of pituitary hormones, and regulation of the gastrointestinal and circulatory systems which can modulate immune responses. Histamine functions are mediated through four G-protein coupled receptors that are named H1–H4 receptor. Histamine is implicated as an important factor in pathophysiology of MS and EAE. It has been shown that histamine can change the permeability of blood brain barrier, which leads to elevation of infiltrated cells in CNS and neuroinflammation. In contrast, there are evidence that show the protective role of histamine in MS and its animal model, EAE. In this review, we try to clarify the role of histamine in pathogenesis of MS, as well as we evaluate the efficacy of histamine receptors agonists and antagonists in treatment of this disease.},

Analyses were enabled for discrete spot sampling by using the Advanced User Interface of the current commercial control software. This software interface provided the parameter control necessary for the NanoMate robotic pipettor to both form and withdraw a liquid microjunction for sampling from a surface. The system was tested with three types of analytically important sample surface types, viz., spotted sample arrays on a MALDI plate, dried blood spots on paper, and whole-body thin tissue sections from drug dosed mice. The qualitative and quantitative data were consistent with previous studies employing other liquid extraction-based surface sampling techniques.},

   abstract = {Mouse models are crucial for the functional annotation of human genome. Gene modification techniques including gene targeting and gene trap in mouse have provided powerful tools in the form of genetically engineered mice (GEM) for understanding the molecular pathogenesis of human diseases. Several international consortium and programs are under way to deliver mutations in every gene in mouse genome. The information from studying these GEM can be shared through international collaboration. However, there are many limitations in utility because not all human genes are knocked out in mouse and they are not yet phenotypically characterized by standardized ways which is required for sharing and evaluating data from GEM. The recent improvement in mouse genetics has now moved the bottleneck in mouse functional genomics from the production of GEM to the systematic mouse phenotype analysis of GEM. Enhanced, reproducible and comprehensive mouse phenotype analysis has thus emerged as a prerequisite for effectively engaging the phenotyping bottleneck. In this review, current information on systematic mouse phenotype analysis and an issue-oriented perspective will be provided.},

   abstract = {DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4) degrades the incretin hormones GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) and GIP (gastric inhibitory polypeptide), decreasing their stimulatory effects on beta-cell insulin secretion. In patients with Type 2 diabetes, meal-related GLP-1 secretion is reduced. DPP-4 inhibitors (alogliptin, saxagliptin, sitagliptin and vildagliptin) correct the GLP-1 deficiency by blocking this degradation, prolonging the incretin effect and enhancing glucose homoeostasis. DPP-4 is a member of a family of ubiquitous atypical serine proteases with many physiological functions beyond incretin degradation, including effects on the endocrine and immune systems. The role of DPP-4 on the immune system relates to its extra-enzymatic activities. The intracytosolic enzymes DPP-8 and DPP-9 are recently discovered DPP-4 family members. Although specific functions of DPP-8 and DPP-9 are unclear, a potential for adverse effects associated with DPP-8 and DPP-9 inhibition by non-selective DPP inhibitors has been posed based on a single adverse preclinical study. However, the preponderance of data suggests that such DPP-8 and DPP-9 enzyme inhibition is probably without clinical consequence. This review examines the structure and function of the DPP-4 family, associated DPP-4 inhibitor selectivity and the implications of DPP-4 inhibition in the treatment of Type 2 diabetes.},

   abstract = {Effective proteome-wide strategies that distinguish the N-termini of proteins from the N-termini of their protease cleavage products would accelerate identification of the substrates of proteases with broad or unknown specificity. Our approach, named terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), addresses this challenge by using dendritic polyglycerol aldehyde polymers that remove tryptic and C-terminal peptides. We analyze unbound naturally acetylated, cyclized or labeled N-termini from proteins and their protease cleavage products by tandem mass spectrometry, and use peptide isotope quantification to discriminate between the substrates of the protease of interest and the products of background proteolysis. We identify 731 acetylated and 132 cyclized N-termini, and 288 matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2 cleavage sites in mouse fibroblast secretomes. We further demonstrate the potential of our strategy to link proteases with defined biological pathways in complex samples by analyzing mouse inflammatory bronchoalveolar fluid and showing that expression of the poorly defined breast cancer protease MMP-11 in MCF-7 human breast cancer cells cleaves both endoplasmin and the immunomodulator and apoptosis inducer galectin-1.},

   abstract = {An essential question in human biology is how cells and tissues differ in gene and protein expression and how these differences delineate specific biological function. Here, we have performed a global analysis of both mRNA and protein levels based on sequence-based transcriptome analysis (RNA-seq), SILAC-based mass spectrometry analysis and antibody-based confocal microscopy. The study was performed in three functionally different human cell lines and based on the global analysis, we estimated the fractions of mRNA and protein that are cell specific or expressed at similar/different levels in the cell lines. A highly ubiquitous RNA expression was found with >60% of the gene products detected in all cells. The changes of mRNA and protein levels in the cell lines using SILAC and RNA ratios show high correlations, even though the genome-wide dynamic range is substantially higher for the proteins as compared with the transcripts. Large general differences in abundance for proteins from various functional classes are observed and, in general, the cell-type specific proteins are low abundant and highly enriched for cell-surface proteins. Thus, this study shows a path to characterize the transcriptome and proteome in human cells from different origins. FAU - Lundberg, Emma},

   abstract = {Naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nTreg) are crucial for maintaining tolerance to self and thus preventing autoimmune diseases and allograft rejections. In cancer, Treg down-regulate antitumor responses by several distinct mechanisms. This study analyzes the role the adenosinergic pathway plays in suppressive activities of human nTreg. Human CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg overexpress CD39 and CD73, ectonucleotidases sequentially converting ATP into AMP and adenosine, which then binds to A(2a) receptors on effector T cells, suppressing their functions. CD4(+)CD39(+) and CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells express low levels of adenosine deaminase (ADA), the enzyme responsible for adenosine breakdown, and of CD26, a surface-bound glycoprotein associated with ADA. In contrast, T effector cells are enriched in CD26/ADA but express low levels of CD39 and CD73. Inhibitors of ectonucleotidase activity (e.g. ARL67156) and antagonists of the A(2a) receptor (e.g. ZM241385) blocked Treg-mediated immunosuppression. The inhibition of ADA activity on effector T cells enhanced Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Thus, human nTreg characterized by the presence of CD39 and the low expression of CD26/ADA are responsible for the generation of adenosine, which plays a major role in Treg-mediated immunosuppression. The data suggest that the adenosinergic pathway represents a potential therapeutic target for regulation of immunosuppression in a broad variety of human diseases.},

Reverse phase protein microarrays (RPMA) are a technology platform designed for quantitative, multiplexed analysis of specific phosphorylated, cleaved, or total (phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated) forms of cellular proteins from a limited amount of sample. This class of microarray can be used to interrogate tissue samples, cells, serum, or body fluids. RPMA were previously a research tool; now this technology has graduated to use in research clinical trials with clinical grade sensitivity and precision. In this review we describe the application of RPMA for multiplexed signal pathway analysis in therapeutic monitoring, biomarker discovery, and evaluation of pharmaceutical targets, and conclude with a summary of the technical aspects of RPMA construction and analysis.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Since fibroblasts in the synovium of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) express the serine proteases fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP-4)/CD26, we undertook the current study to determine the functional role of both enzymes in the invasion of RA synovial fibroblasts (RASFs) into articular cartilage. METHODS: Expression of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 by RASFs was analyzed using fluorescence-activated cell sorting and immunocytochemistry. Serine protease activity was measured by cleavage of fluorogenic substrates and inhibited upon treatment with L-glutamyl L-boroproline. The induction and expression of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) and tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) in RASFs were detected using real-time polymerase chain reaction. Densitometric measurements of MMPs using immunoblotting confirmed our findings on the messenger RNA level. Stromal cell-derived factor 1 (SDF-1 [CXCL12]), MMP-1, and MMP-3 protein levels were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The impact of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 inhibition on the invasiveness of RASFs was analyzed in the SCID mouse coimplantation model of RA using immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: Inhibition of serine protease activity of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 in vitro led to increased levels of SDF-1 in concert with MMP-1 and MMP-3, which are downstream effectors of SDF-1 signaling. Using the SCID mouse coimplantation model, inhibition of enzymatic activity in vivo significantly promoted invasion of xenotransplanted RASFs into cotransplanted human cartilage. Zones of cartilage resorption were infiltrated by FAP-expressing RASFs and marked by a significantly higher accumulation of MMP-1 and MMP-3, when compared with controls. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate a central role for the serine protease activity of FAP and DPP-4/CD26 in protecting articular cartilage against invasion by synovial fibroblasts in RA.},

   abstract = {Nanostructure-initiator mass spectrometry (NIMS) is a highly sensitive, matrix-free technique that is well suited for biofluid analysis and imaging of biological tissues. Here we provide a new technical variation of NIMS to analyze carbohydrates and steroids, molecules that are challenging to detect with traditional mass spectrometric approaches. Analysis of carbohydrates and steroids was accomplished by spray depositing NaCl or AgNO(3) on the NIMS porous silicon surface to provide a uniform environment rich with cationization agents prior to desorption of the fluorinated polymer initiator. Laser desorption/ionization of the ion-coated NIMS surface allowed for Na(+) cationization of carbohydrates and Ag(+) cationization of steroids. The reliability of the approach is quantitatively demonstrated with a calibration curve over the physiological range of glucose and cholesterol concentrations in human serum (1-200 microM). Additionally, we illustrate the sensitivity of the method by showing its ability to detect carbohydrates and steroids down to the 800-amol and 100-fmol levels, respectively. The technique developed is well suited for tissue imaging of biologically significant metabolites such as sucrose and cholesterol. To highlight its applicability, we used cation-enhanced NIMS to image the distribution of sucrose in a Gerbera jamesonii flower stem and the distribution of cholesterol in a mouse brain. The flower stem and brain sections were placed directly on the ion-coated NIMS surface without further preparation and analyzed directly. The overall results reported underscore the potential of NIMS to analyze and image chemically diverse compounds that have been traditionally challenging to observe with mass spectrometry-based techniques.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase (DP) 8 belongs to the dipeptidyl peptidase IV gene family. DP8 has been implicated in immune function and asthma, although its biological function is yet unknown. Structures of the homologs, fibroblast activation protein (FAP) and DPIV, are known but the DP8 structure is yet to be resolved. To help characterise the DP8 substrate pocket, mutants of residues lining the pocket were produced at DP8(D772), DP8(Y315), DP8(H434) and DP8(D435) and assessed by substrate kinetics and size-exclusion chromatography. Mutations of DP8(D772A/E/S/V) affected catalysis but did not confer endopeptidase activity. Mutations of DP8(H434F), DP8(D435F) and DP8(Y315F) reduced catalytic activity. Furthermore, mutations to DP8(D772A/E/S/V), DP8(H434F), DP8(D435F) and DP8(Y315F) affected dimer stabilisation. Homology modelling of DP8 using DPIV and FAP crystal structures suggested that DP8(D772), DP8(H434) and DP8(D435) were located at the edge of the S2 catalytic pocket, contributing to the junction between the alpha-beta hydrolase and beta-propeller domains. This study provides insights into how the DP8 substrate pocket and dimer interface differ from DPIV and FAP which could be utilised for designing more selective DP8 inhibitors.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Although 25% to 44% of patients with heart failure (HF) have diabetes mellitus (DM), the optimal treatment regimen for HF patients with DM is uncertain. We investigated the association between metformin therapy and outcomes in a cohort of advanced, systolic HF patients with DM. METHODS AND RESULTS: Patients with DM and advanced, systolic HF (n = 401) were followed at a single university HF center between 1994 and 2008. The cohort was divided into 2 groups based on the presence or absence of metformin therapy. The cohort had a mean age of 56 +/- 11 years, left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) of 24 +/- 7%, with 42% being New York Heart Association (NYHA) III and 45% NYHA IV. Twenty-five percent (n = 99) were treated with metformin therapy. The groups treated and not treated with metformin were similar in terms of age, sex, baseline LVEF, medical history, and baseline glycosylated hemoglobin. Metformin-treated patients had a higher body mass index, lower creatinine, and were less often on insulin. One-year survival in metformin-treated and non-metformin-treated patients was 91% and 76%, respectively (RR = 0.37, CI 0.18-0.76, P = .007). After multivariate adjustment for demographics, cardiac function, renal function, and HF medications, metformin therapy was associated with a nonsignificant trend for improved survival. CONCLUSION: In patients with DM and advanced, systolic HF who are closely monitored, metformin therapy appears to be safe. Prospective studies are needed to determine whether metformin can improve HF outcome.},

Coordination of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteolysis and cell signalling by uPAR underlies its important function in cell migration, proliferation and survival and makes it an attractive therapeutic target in cancer and inflammatory diseases. uPAR lacks transmembrane and intracellular domains and so requires transmembrane co-receptors for signalling. Integrins are essential uPAR signalling co-receptors and a second uPAR ligand, the ECM protein vitronectin, is also crucial for this process.},

In this study, we investigated 22 human meningiomas for the expression of dipeptidyl peptidase (DPP)-IV activity and/or structure homologs (DASH), including canonical DPP-IV/CD26, fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAPalpha), DPP8 and DPP9. DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity, including all enzymatically-active DASH molecules, was found in all 18 benign meningiomas WHO grade I and IV atypical meningiomas WHO grade II by continuous rate fluorimetric assay in tissue homogenates and catalytic enzyme histochemistry in situ. In atypical meningiomas, this activity was significantly higher and was associated with higher cell proliferation as detected by Ki67 antigen immunohistochemistry. The expression of DPP-IV/CD26 and FAPalpha demonstrated by real-time RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry was low. As shown histochemically, it occurred most often on the surface of fibrous bundles and whorls rich in extracellular matrix. Compared to DPP-IV/CD26 and FAPalpha, the expression of DPP8 and DPP9 was higher and, in addition, it was present also in the cells inside these structures. Expression of CXCR4, the receptor of pro-proliferative chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1alpha (SDF-1alpha), DPP-IV substrate, was found in all tumors, suggesting higher values in atypical grade II samples. This is the first report on the expression status of dipeptidyl peptidase-IV and related molecules in meningiomas. It shows that DPP8 and DPP9 prevail over canonical DPP-IV/CD26 and FAPalpha in all examined patients. In addition, the study suggests an increase of DPP-IV-like enzymatic activity in these tumors of WHO grade II.},

To further explore this concept we have characterized the expression of all DPIV-like enzymes in chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). We have demonstrated the constitutive expression of DPIV, DP8, DP9, DPII and PEP mRNA and DPIV, DP8 and DP9 protein in CLL. FAP mRNA was not detected in CLL or normal B-lymphocytes. This correlated with an absence of FAP protein on the cell surface. This study also shows that DP8 mRNA expression is significantly upregulated in CLL compared to normal tonsil B-lymphocytes (p < 0.05) which may suggest biological importance in this disease. DP expression could not be correlated with any molecular or clinical prognostic markers for CLL in this cohort including IgVH mutational status, CD38, ZAP-70 or CD49d expression (n = 58). However, the constitutive expression of the DPIV-like enzymes in CLL and their emergence as potent immune regulators makes them candidate therapeutic targets in this disease.},

   abstract = {In recent years, the biological sciences have seen a surge in the development of methods, including high-throughput global methods, for the quantitative measurement of biomolecule levels (i.e., RNA, proteins, metabolites) from cells and tissues. Just as important as quantitation of biomolecules has been the creation of approaches that uncover the regulatory and signaling connections between biomolecules. Our specific interest is in understanding peptide metabolism in a physiological setting, and this has led us to develop a multidisciplinary approach that integrates genetics, analytical chemistry, synthetic chemistry, biochemistry, and chemical biology to identify the substrates of peptidases in vivo. To accomplish this we utilize a liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based peptidomics platform to measure changes in the peptidome as a function of peptidase activity. Previous analysis of mice lacking the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4(-/-) mice), a biomedically relevant peptidase, using this approach identified a handful of novel endogenous DPP4 substrates. Here, we utilize these substrates and tissues from DPP4(-/-) mice to improve the coverage of the peptidomics platform by optimizing the key steps in the workflow, and in doing so, discover over 70 renal DPP4 substrates (up from 7 at the beginning of our optimization), a 10-fold improvement in our coverage. The sequences of these DPP4 peptide substrates support a broad role for DPP4 in proline-containing peptide catabolism and strengthen a biochemical model that interlinks aminopeptidase and DPP4 activities. Moreover, the improved peptidome coverage also led to the detection of greater numbers of known bioactive peptides (e.g., peptide hormones) during the analysis of gut samples, suggesting additional uses for this optimized workflow. Together these results strengthen our ability to identify endogenous peptide substrates through improved peptidome coverage and demonstrate a broader potential of this peptidomics platform.},

   abstract = {The EB-eye is a fast and efficient search engine that provides easy and uniform access to the biological data resources hosted at the EMBL-EBI. Currently, users can access information from more than 62 distinct datasets covering some 400 million entries. The data resources represented in the EB-eye include: nucleotide and protein sequences at both the genomic and proteomic levels, structures ranging from chemicals to macro-molecular complexes, gene-expression experiments, binary level molecular interactions as well as reaction maps and pathway models, functional classifications, biological ontologies, and comprehensive literature libraries covering the biomedical sciences and related intellectual property. The EB-eye can be accessed over the web or programmatically using a SOAP Web Services interface. This allows its search and retrieval capabilities to be exploited in workflows and analytical pipe-lines. The EB-eye is a novel alternative to existing biological search and retrieval engines. In this article we describe in detail how to exploit its powerful capabilities.},

Commercially available nanostructured surfaces (nano-assisted laser desorption-ionization or NALDI) are used as substrates for imprinting of tissue sections. The lithographic transfers are then washed and the two-dimensional distribution of the lipids is imaged by laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry. The NALDI imaging of lipid transfers is compared with standard MALDI imaging of matrix-coated tissue sections. The obtained images are of the same quality, and no spatial information is lost due to the imprinting process. NALDI imaging is faster due to the absence of the time-consuming matrix deposition step, and the NALDI mass spectra are less complex and easier to interpret than standard MALDI. In this particular application example, NALDI mass spectrometry is able to identify the same lipid species as MALDI mass spectrometry and provides better distinction between kidney and adrenal gland tissues based on the lipid analysis.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: We have previously demonstrated that inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase (DP) activity partially attenuates dextran sulfate sodium (DSS) colitis in mice. The aim of this study was to further investigate the mechanisms of this protection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Wildtype (WT) and DPIV(-/-) mice consumed 2% DSS in drinking water for 6 days to induce colitis. Mice were treated with saline or the DP inhibitors Ile-Pyrr-(2-CN)*TFA or Ile-Thia. DP mRNA and enzyme levels were measured in the colon. Glucagon-like peptide (GLP)-2 and GLP-1 concentrations were determined by radioimmunoassay, regulatory T-cells (Tregs) by fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) on FOXp3+T cells in blood, and neutrophil infiltration assessed by myeloperoxidase (MPO) assay. RESULTS: DP8 and DP2 mRNA levels were increased (P < 0.05) in WT+saline mice compared to untreated WT mice with colitis. Cytoplasmic DP enzyme activity was increased (P < 0.05) in DPIV(-/-) mice at day 6 of DSS, while DP2 activity was increased (P < 0.05) in WT mice with colitis. GLP-1 (63%) and GLP-2 (50%) concentrations increased in WT+Ile-Pyrr-(2-CN)*TFA mice compared to day-0 controls. MPO activity was lower in WT+Ile-Thia and WT+Ile-Pyrr-(2-CN)*TFA treated mice compared to WT+saline (P < 0.001) at day 6 colitis. CONCLUSIONS: DP expression and activity are differentially regulated during DSS colitis, suggesting a pathophysiological role for these enzymes in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). DP inhibitors impaired neutrophil recruitment and maintenance of the Treg population during DSS-colitis, providing further preclinical evidence for the potential therapeutic use of these inhibitors in IBD. Finally, DPIV appears to play a critical role in mediating the protective effect of DP inhibitors.},

   abstract = {Studies have demonstrated defects of DA and 5 HT neurotransmission in dietary fat induced obese animals. In the present study, we used a perfusion system to assay the release of DA and 5 HT from striatal slices preloaded with [3H]-DA or [3H]-5 HT. The release of both DA and 5 HT from striatal slices of rats fed a high fat diet for 10 days, but not 3 days, was reduced when compared to striatal slices taken from rats fed a low fat diet. Enterostatin, an endogenous pentapeptide inhibits dietary fat intake when administered peripherally and centrally in animals. The central mechanism for the action of enterostatin is not yet determined even though several mechanisms have been suggested. We have shown that enterostatin enhanced [3H]-DA release, but not [3H]-5HT release from striatal slices of rats that had been adapted to high fat diet for 10 days. The enterostatin-induced increase in [3H]-DA release was blocked by nomifensine. Enterostatin did not alter [3H]-DA or [3H]-5HT release from striatal slices of rats adapted to high fat or low fat diet feeding for 3 days. These findings suggest that enterostatin may inhibit dietary fat intake by blocking dopamine reuptake transport to increase central striatal DA release from rats that have acquired diminished dopamine signal after an adaptive period of fat consumption.},

   abstract = {Of the 600+ known proteases identified to date in mammals, a significant percentage is involved or implicated in pathogenic and cancer processes. The dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPIV) gene family, comprising four enzyme members [DPIV (EC 3.4.14.5), fibroblast activation protein, DP8 and DP9] and two nonenzyme members [DP6 (DPL1) and DP10 (DPL2)], are interesting in this regard because of their multiple diverse functions, varying patterns of distribution/localization and subtle, but significant, differences in structure/substrate recognition. In addition, their engagement in cell biological processes involves both enzymatic and nonenzymatic capabilities. This article examines, in detail, our current understanding of the biological involvement of this unique enzyme family and their overall potential as therapeutic targets.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Despite the common coexistence of diabetes and heart failure (HF), the optimal medial treatment of diabetes in HF patients has not been well studied. We sought to compare the association between metformin use and clinical outcomes in a cohort of ambulatory patients with diabetes and established HF. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using propensity score-matched samples, we examined the association between metformin use and the risk of death or risk of hospitalization in a national cohort of 6185 patients with HF and diabetes treated in ambulatory clinics at Veteran Affairs medical centers. In this cohort, 1561 (25.2%) patients were treated with metformin. At 2 years of follow-up, death occurred in 246 (15.8%) patients receiving metformin and in 1177 (25.5%) patients not receiving metformin (P<0.001). In the propensity score-matched analysis (n=2874), death occurred in 232 (16.1%) patients receiving metformin compared with 285 (19.8%) patients not receiving metformin (hazard ratio, 0.76; 95% confidence interval, 0.63 to 0.92; P<0.01). In propensity score-matched analyses, HF hospitalization or total hospitalization rates were not significantly different between individuals treated with metformin compared with those not treated with metformin (hazard ratio, 0.93; 95% confidence interval, 0.74 to 1.18; and hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% confidence interval, 0.83 to 1.07, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Metformin therapy was associated with lower rates of mortality in ambulatory patients with diabetes and HF. Future prospective studies are necessary to define the optimal therapy for diabetic patients with HF.},

   abstract = {Catestatin, a neuroendocrine peptide with effects on human autonomic function, has recently been found to be a cutaneous antimicrobial peptide. Human catestatin exhibits three single nucleotide polymorphisms: Gly364Ser, Pro370Leu and Arg374Gln. Given reports indicating that antimicrobial peptides and neuropeptides induce mast cell activation, we postulated that catestatin might stimulate numerous functions of human mast cells, thereby participating in the regulation of skin inflammatory responses. Catestatin and its naturally occurring variants caused the human mast cell line LAD2 and peripheral blood-derived mast cells to migrate, degranulate and release leukotriene C(4) and prostaglandins D(2) and E(2). Moreover, catestatins increased intracellular Ca(2+) mobilization in mast cells, and induced the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines/chemokines such as granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor, monocyte chemotactic protein-1/CCL2, macrophage inflammatory protein-1alpha/CCL3 and macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta/CCL4. Our evaluation of possible cellular mechanisms suggested that G-proteins, phospholipase C and the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) are involved in catestatin-induced mast cell activation as evidenced by the inhibitory effects of pertussis toxin (G-protein inhibitor), U-73122 (phospholipase C inhibitor) and U0126 (ERK inhibitor), respectively. We also found that human mast cells express the alpha7 subunit of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor at both the mRNA and protein levels. Given that silencing the alpha7 receptor mRNA and an alpha7-specific inhibitor did not affect catestatin-mediated activation of mast cells, however, we concluded that this receptor is not likely to be functional in human mast cell stimulation by catestatins. Our finding that the neuroendocrine antimicrobial peptide catestatin activates human mast cells suggests that this peptide might have immunomodulatory functions, and provides a new link between neuroendocrine and cutaneous immune systems.},

   abstract = {Proteomics-based approaches allow us to investigate the biology of cancer beyond genomic initiatives. We used histology-based matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry to identify proteins that predict disease outcome in gastric cancer after surgical resection. A total of 181 intestinal-type primary resected gastric cancer tissues from two independent patient cohorts were analyzed. Protein profiles of the discovery cohort (n = 63) were directly obtained from tumor tissue sections by MALDI imaging. A seven-protein signature was associated with an unfavorable overall survival independent of major clinical covariates. The prognostic significance of three individual proteins identified (CRIP1, HNP-1, and S100-A6) was validated immunohistochemically on tissue microarrays of an independent validation cohort (n = 118). Whereas HNP-1 and S100-A6 were found to further subdivide early-stage (Union Internationale Contre le Cancer [UICC]-I) and late-stage (UICC II and III) cancer patients into different prognostic groups, CRIP1, a protein previously unknown in gastric cancer, was confirmed as a novel and independent prognostic factor for all patients in the validation cohort. The protein pattern described here serves as a new independent indicator of patient survival complementing the previously known clinical parameters in terms of prognostic relevance. These results show that this tissue-based proteomic approach may provide clinically relevant information that might be beneficial in improving risk stratification for gastric cancer patients.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is widely considered to be associated with risk of pancreatic cancer (PaC), however, whether DM is a cause or a consequence of PaC is still controversial. We examined this association by conducting a detailed meta-analysis of cohort studies. METHODS: Studies were identified by searching Medline and Embase through November 30, 2010. Summary relative risks (RRs) with their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. RESULTS: A total of thirty-five cohort studies were included in this meta-analysis. DM was associated with an increased risk of PaC (the summary RRs=1.94; 95% CI, 1.66-2.27), with significant evidence of heterogeneity among these studies (p<0.001, I(2)=93.6%). Subgroup analyses revealed that the increased risk of PaC was independent of geographic locations, sex, study design, alcohol consumption, body mass index (BMI) and smoking status. In addition, the relative risk of PaC was correlated negatively with the duration of DM, with the highest risk of PaC found among patients diagnosed within less than 1 year. There was no significant publication bias (p=0.136 for Egger's regression asymmetry test). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this meta-analysis strongly support that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of PaC in both males and females and that DM is both an early manifestation and an etiologic factor of pancreatic cancer.},

   abstract = {Proteomics experiments based on state-of-the-art mass spectrometry produce vast amounts of data, which cannot be analyzed manually. Hence, software is needed which is able to analyze the data in an automated fashion. The need for robust and reusable software tools triggered the development of libraries implementing different algorithms for the various analysis steps. OpenMS is such a software library and provides a wealth of data structures and algorithms for the analysis of mass spectrometric data. For users unfamiliar with programming, TOPP ("The OpenMS Proteomics Pipeline") offers a wide range of already implemented tools sharing the same interface and designed for a specific analysis task each. TOPP thus makes the sophisticated algorithms of OpenMS accessible to nonprogrammers. The individual TOPP tools can be strung together into pipelines for analyzing mass spectrometry-based experiments starting from the raw output of the mass spectrometer. These analysis pipelines can be constructed using a graphical editor. Even complex analytical workflows can thus be analyzed with ease.},

   abstract = {AIMS: Collagen degradation in atherosclerotic plaques with thin fibrous caps renders them more prone to rupture. Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) plays a role in arthritis and tumour formation through its collagenase activity. However, the significance of FAP in thin-cap human fibroatheromata remains unknown. METHODS AND RESULTS: We detected enhanced FAP expression in type IV-V human aortic atheromata (n = 12), compared with type II-III lesions (n = 9; P < 0.01) and healthy aortae (n = 8; P < 0.01) by immunostaining and western blot analyses. Fibroblast activation protein was also increased in thin-cap (<65 microm) vs. thick-cap (>/= 65 microm) human coronary fibroatheromata (n = 12; P < 0.01). Fibroblast activation protein was expressed by human aortic smooth muscle cells (HASMC) as shown by colocalization on immunofluorescent aortic plaque stainings (n = 10; P < 0.01) and by flow cytometry in cell culture. Although macrophages did not express FAP, macrophage burden in human aortic plaques correlated with FAP expression (n = 12; R(2)= 0.763; P < 0.05). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays showed a time- and dose-dependent up-regulation of FAP in response to human tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in HASMC (n = 6; P < 0.01). Moreover, supernatants from peripheral blood-derived macrophages induced FAP expression in cultured HASMC (n = 6; P < 0.01), an effect abolished by blocking TNFalpha (n = 6; P < 0.01). Fibroblast activation protein associated with collagen-poor regions in human coronary fibrous caps and digested type I collagen and gelatin in vitro (n = 6; P < 0.01). Zymography revealed that FAP-mediated collagenase activity was neutralized by an antibody directed against the FAP catalytic domain both in HASMC (n = 6; P < 0.01) and in fibrous caps of atherosclerotic plaques (n = 10; P < 0.01). CONCLUSION: Fibroblast activation protein expression in HASMC is induced by macrophage-derived TNFalpha. Fibroblast activation protein associates with thin-cap human coronary fibroatheromata and contributes to type I collagen breakdown in fibrous caps.},

   abstract = {Proteome identification using peptide-centric proteomics techniques is a routinely used analysis technique. One of the most powerful and popular methods for the identification of peptides from MS/MS spectra is protein database matching using search engines. Significance thresholding through false discovery rate (FDR) estimation by target/decoy searches is used to ensure the retention of predominantly confident assignments of MS/MS spectra to peptides. However, shortcomings have become apparent when such decoy searches are used to estimate the FDR. To study these shortcomings, we here introduce a novel kind of decoy database that contains isobaric mutated versions of the peptides that were identified in the original search. Because of the supervised way in which the entrapment sequences are generated, we call this a directed decoy database. Since the peptides found in our directed decoy database are thus specifically designed to look quite similar to the forward identifications, the limitations of the existing search algorithms in making correct calls in such strongly confusing situations can be analyzed. Interestingly, for the vast majority of confidently identified peptide identifications, a directed decoy peptide-to-spectrum match can be found that has a better or equal match score than the forward match score, highlighting an important issue in the interpretation of peptide identifications in present-day high-throughput proteomics.},

   abstract = {Top-down mass spectrometry is an emerging approach for the analysis of intact proteins. The term was coined as a contrast with the better-established, bottom-up strategy for analysis of peptide fragments derived from digestion, either enzymatically or chemically, of intact proteins. Although the term top-down originates from proteomics, it can also be applied to mass spectrometric analysis of intact large biomolecules that are constituents of protein assemblies or complexes. Traditionally, mass spectrometry has usually started with intact molecules, and in this regard, top-down approaches reflect the spirit of mass spectrometry. This article provides an overview of the methodologies in top-down mass spectrometry and then reviews applications covering protein posttranslational modifications, protein biophysics, DNAs/RNAs, and protein assemblies. Finally, challenges and future directions are discussed.},

   abstract = {Proteolytic processing modifies the pleiotropic functions of many large, complex, and modular proteins and can generate cleavage products with new biological activity. The identification of exact proteolytic cleavage sites in the extracellular matrix laminins, fibronectin, and other extracellular matrix proteins is not only important for understanding protein turnover but is needed for the identification of new bioactive cleavage products. Several such products have recently been recognized that are suggested to play important cellular regulatory roles in processes, including angiogenesis. However, identifying multiple cleavage sites in extracellular matrix proteins and other large proteins is challenging as N-terminal Edman sequencing of multiple and often closely spaced cleavage fragments on SDS-PAGE gels is difficult, thus limiting throughput and coverage. We developed a new liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry approach we call amino-terminal oriented mass spectrometry of substrates (ATOMS) for the N-terminal identification of protein cleavage fragments in solution. ATOMS utilizes efficient and low cost dimethylation isotopic labeling of original N-terminal and proteolytically generated N termini of protein cleavage fragments followed by quantitative tandem mass spectrometry analysis. Being a peptide-centric approach, ATOMS is not dependent on the SDS-PAGE resolution limits for protein fragments of similar mass. We demonstrate that ATOMS reliably identifies multiple proteolytic sites per reaction in complex proteins. Fifty-five neutrophil elastase cleavage sites were identified in laminin-1 and fibronectin-1 with 34 more identified by matrix metalloproteinase cleavage. Hence, our degradomics approach offers a complimentary alternative to Edman sequencing with broad applicability in identifying N termini such as cleavage sites in complex high molecular weight extracellular matrix proteins after in vitro cleavage assays. ATOMS can therefore be useful in identifying new cleavage products of extracellular matrix proteins cleaved by proteases in pathology for bioactivity screening.},

Entrez capitalizes on the fact that there are pre-existing, logical relationships between the individual entries found in numerous public databases. The existence of such natural connections, mostly biological in nature, argued for the development of a method through which all the information about a particular biological entity could be found without having to sequentially visit and query disparate databases. Two basic protocols describe simple, text-based searches, illustrating the types of information that can be retrieved through the Entrez system. An alternate protocol builds upon the first basic protocol, using additional, built-in features of the Entrez system, and providing alternative ways to issue the initial query. The support protocol reviews how to save frequently issued queries. Finally, Cn3D, a structure visualization tool, is also discussed.},

SP proinflammatory effects are terminated by angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) and neutral endopeptidase (NEP), while the aminopeptidase dipeptidylpeptidase IV (DPPIV) can also play a role. The aim of this randomized, crossover, double-blind study was to assess the cutaneous vasoreactivity (flare and wheal reaction, burning pain sensation) to intradermal injection of ascending doses of SP in six volunteers receiving a single therapeutic dose of the DPPIV inhibitor sitagliptin or a matching placebo. Cutaneous SP challenges produced the expected, dose-dependent flare and wheal response, while eliciting mild to moderate local pain sensation with little dose dependency. However, no differences were shown in the responses observed under sitagliptin compared with placebo, while the study would have been sufficiently powered to detect a clinically relevant increase in sensitivity to SP. The results of this pilot study are in line with proteolytic cleavage of SP by ACE and NEP compensating the blockade of DPPIV to prevent an augmentation of its proinflammatory action.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAPalpha) is a tumor-associated antigen uniquely expressed by reactive stromal fibroblasts in the majority of human epithelial tumors. FAPalpha also possesses both post-prolyl peptidase and endopeptidase activities. Consequently, FAPalpha is increasingly considered as a potential pan-tumor target for designing tumor-targeted prodrugs. We previously conjugated Doxorubicin (Dox) with a FAPalpha-specific dipeptide (Z-Gly-Pro) to develop a FAPalpha-targeting prodrug of Dox (FTPD). The aim of current work was to validate the tumor targeting of this targeted-delivery strategy. The results demonstrated that FTPD could effectually release Dox upon the hydrolysis of FAPalpha as well as the incubation with tumor homogenate of FAPalpha-positive tumor (4T1 tumor), while it was highly stable in mouse plasma and a variety of tissue homogenates including heart, liver, and so on. And the FAPalpha-cleaved FTPD exhibited significantly higher cytotoxicity against 4T1 cells in vitro than the uncatalyzed prodrug. Additionally, FTPD produced similar antitumor efficacy in 4T1 tumor-bearing mice to free Dox without obvious cardiotoxic effect. Moreover, subsequent study indicated that the accumulation of FTPD reduced significantly in the heart compared to free Dox. These findings suggest that such FAPalpha-based prodrug strategy is promising to achieve targeted delivery of antitumor agents.},

   abstract = {The ability to sequence genomes has far outstripped approaches for deciphering the information they encode. Here we present a suite of techniques, based on ribosome profiling (the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments), to provide genome-wide maps of protein synthesis as well as a pulse-chase strategy for determining rates of translation elongation. We exploit the propensity of harringtonine to cause ribosomes to accumulate at sites of translation initiation together with a machine learning algorithm to define protein products systematically. Analysis of translation in mouse embryonic stem cells reveals thousands of strong pause sites and unannotated translation products. These include amino-terminal extensions and truncations and upstream open reading frames with regulatory potential, initiated at both AUG and non-AUG codons, whose translation changes after differentiation. We also define a class of short, polycistronic ribosome-associated coding RNAs (sprcRNAs) that encode small proteins. Our studies reveal an unanticipated complexity to mammalian proteomes.
Graphical Abstract
Highlights ► Ribosome-profiling technique reveals complexity of mammalian proteome ► Many transcripts previously characterized as noncoding are in fact translated ► Translation proceeds at 5.6 codons per second and stalls at Pro-Pro-Glu motifs ► mESC differentiation involves global shifts in upstream translation
A high-resolution look at mammalian translation reveals unanticipated diversity in the resulting proteome, including peptide products from putative noncoding RNAs.},

   abstract = {Increasing evidence suggests that a history of diabetes mellitus (DM) may be associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC). To provide a quantitative assessment of the association between DM and risk of CRC, We evaluated the relation between DM and incidence and mortality of CRC in a systematic review of cohort studies. Full publications of cohort studies were identified in MEDLINE, EMBASE and Science Citation Index Expanded, through February 28, 2011. Summary relative risks (SRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were summarized using a random-effects model. Between-study heterogeneity was assessed using the Cochran's Q and I2 statistics. A total of 41 cohort studies (35 articles) were included in this systematic review. Combining 30 cohort studies which presented results on diabetes and CRC incidence, diabetes was associated with an increased incidence of CRC (SRRs 1.27, 95% CI: 1.21-1.34), with evident heterogeneity among studies (P=0.002, I2=48.4%). Subgroup analysis and meta-regression analysis by controlling the confounders showed that the increased incidence of CRC was independent of geographic locations, sex, family history of colorectal cancer, smoking, physical activity and body mass index. Diabetes was also positively associated with CRC mortality (SRR 1.20, 95% CI: 1.03-1.40), with evidence of heterogeneity between studies (P<0.001, I2=81.4%). Results from this systematic review support that compared to non-diabetic individuals, diabetic individuals have an increased risk of CRC.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein-alpha (FAP) is a cell surface-expressed and soluble enzyme of the prolyl oligopeptidase family, which includes dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). FAP is not generally expressed in normal adult tissues, but is found at high levels in activated myofibroblasts and hepatic stellate cells in fibrosis and in stromal fibroblasts of epithelial tumours. FAP possesses a rare catalytic activity, hydrolysis of the post-proline bond two or more residues from the N-terminus of target substrates. alpha(2)-antiplasmin is an important physiological substrate of FAP endopeptidase activity. This study reports the first natural substrates of FAP dipeptidyl peptidase activity. Neuropeptide Y, B-type natriuretic peptide, substance P and peptide YY were the most efficiently hydrolysed substrates and the first hormone substrates of FAP to be identified. In addition, FAP slowly hydrolysed other hormone peptides, such as the incretins glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, which are efficient DPP4 substrates. FAP showed negligible or no hydrolysis of eight chemokines that are readily hydrolysed by DPP4. This novel identification of FAP substrates furthers our understanding of this unique protease by indicating potential roles in cardiac function and neurobiology.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Comprehensive proteomic profiling of the human adipocyte secretome identified dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) as a novel adipokine. This study assessed the functional implications of the adipokine DPP4 and its association to the metabolic syndrome. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Human adipocytes and skeletal and smooth muscle cells were used to monitor DPP4 release and assess the effects of soluble DPP4 on insulin signaling. In lean and obese subjects, depot-specific expression of DPP4 and its release from adipose tissue explants were determined and correlated to parameters of the metabolic syndrome. RESULTS: Fully differentiated adipocytes exhibit a substantially higher release of DPP4 compared with preadipocytes or macrophages. Direct addition of DPP4 to fat and skeletal and smooth muscle cells impairs insulin signaling. A fivefold higher level of DPP4 protein expression was seen in visceral compared with subcutaneous fat of obese patients, with no regional difference in lean subjects. DPP4 serum concentrations significantly correlated with adipocyte size. By using adipose tissue explants from lean and obese subjects, we observed a twofold increase in DPP4 release that strongly correlated with adipocyte volume and parameters of the metabolic syndrome and was decreased to the lean level after weight reduction. DPP4 released from adipose tissue correlated positively with an increasing risk score for the metabolic syndrome. CONCLUSIONS: DPP4 is a novel adipokine that may impair insulin sensitivity in an autocrine and paracrine fashion. Furthermore, DPP4 release strongly correlates with adipocyte size, potentially representing an important source of DPP4 in obesity. Therefore, we suggest that DPP4 may be involved in linking adipose tissue and the metabolic syndrome.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Resistance of thrombi to plasmin digestion depends primarily on the amount of alpha(2)-antiplasmin (alpha(2)AP) incorporated within fibrin. Circulating prolyl-specific serine proteinase, antiplasmin-cleaving enzyme (APCE), a homologue of fibroblast activation protein (FAP), cleaves precursor Met-alpha(2)AP between -Pro12-Asn13- to yield Asn-alpha(2)AP, which is crosslinked to fibrin approximately 13x more rapidly than Met-alpha(2)AP and confers resistance to plasmin. We reasoned that an APCE inhibitor might decrease conversion of Met-alpha(2)AP to Asn-alpha(2)AP and thereby enhance endogenous fibrinolysis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We designed and synthesized several APCE inhibitors and assessed each vs. plasma dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPPIV) and prolyl oligopeptidase (POP), which have amino acid sequence similarity with APCE. Acetyl-Arg-(8-amino-3,6-dioxaoctanoic acid)-D-Ala-L-boroPro selectively inhibited APCE vs. DPPIV, with an apparent K(i) of 5.7 nm vs. 6.1 mum, indicating that an approximately 1000-fold greater inhibitor concentration is required for DPPIV than for APCE. An apparent K(i) of 7.4 nm was found for POP inhibition, which is similar to 5.7 nm for APCE; however, the potential problem of overlapping FAP/APCE and POP inhibition was negated by our finding that normal human plasma lacks POP activity. The inhibitor construct caused a dose-dependent decrease of APCE-mediated Met-alpha(2)AP cleavage, which ultimately shortened plasminogen activator-induced plasma clot lysis times. Incubation of the inhibitor with human plasma for 22 h did not lessen its APCE inhibitory activity, with its IC(50) value in plasma remaining comparable to that in phosphate buffer. CONCLUSION: These data establish that inhibition of APCE might represent a therapeutic approach for enhancing thrombolytic activity.},

   abstract = {Ewing sarcoma family of tumors (ESFT) is a group of aggressive pediatric malignancies driven by the EWS-FLI1 fusion protein, an aberrant transcription factor up-regulating specific target genes, such as neuropeptide Y (NPY) and its Y1 and Y5 receptors (Y5Rs). Previously, we have shown that both exogenous NPY and endogenous NPY stimulate ESFT cell death via its Y1 and Y5Rs. Here, we demonstrate that this effect is prevented by dipeptidyl peptidases (DPPs), which cleave NPY to its shorter form, NPY(3-36), not active at Y1Rs. We have shown that NPY-induced cell death can be abolished by overexpression of DPPs and enhanced by their down-regulation. Both NPY treatment and DPP blockade activated the same cell death pathway mediated by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP-1) and apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF). Moreover, the decrease in cell survival induced by DPP inhibition was blocked by Y1 and Y5R antagonists, confirming its dependence on endogenous NPY. Interestingly, similar levels of NPY-driven cell death were achieved by blocking membrane DPPIV and cytosolic DPP8 and DPP9. Thus, this is the first evidence of these intracellular DPPs cleaving releasable peptides, such as NPY, in live cells. In contrast, another membrane DPP, fibroblast activation protein (FAP), did not affect NPY actions. In conclusion, DPPs act as survival factors for ESFT cells and protect them from cell death induced by endogenous NPY. This is the first demonstration that intracellular DPPs are involved in regulation of ESFT growth and may become potential therapeutic targets for these tumors.},

Online liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution MS and MS/MS yielded 166 420 peptides with unique amino-acid sequence from HeLa cells. These peptides identified 10 255 different human proteins encoded by 9207 human genes, providing a lower limit on the proteome in this cancer cell line. Deep transcriptome sequencing revealed transcripts for nearly all detected proteins. We calculate copy numbers for the expressed proteins and show that the abundances of > 90% of them are within a factor 60 of the median protein expression level. Comparisons of the proteome and the transcriptome, and analysis of protein complex databases and GO categories, suggest that we achieved deep coverage of the functional transcriptome and the proteome of a single cell type.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging is a versatile method to analyze the spatial distribution of analytes in tissue sections. It provides unique features for the analysis of drug compounds in pharmacokinetic studies such as label-free detection and differentiation of compounds and metabolites. We have recently introduced a MS imaging method that combines high mass resolution and high spatial resolution in a single experiment, hence termed HR2 MS imaging. In the present study, we applied this method to analyze the spatial distribution of the anti-cancer drugs imatinib and ifosfamide in individual mouse organs. The whole kidney of an animal dosed with imatinib was measured at 35 μm spatial resolution. Imatinib showed a well-defined distribution in the outer stripe of the outer medulla. This area was analyzed in more detail at 10 μm step size, which constitutes a tenfold increase in effective spatial resolution compared to previous studies of drug compounds. In parallel, ion images of phospholipids and heme were used to characterize the histological features of the tissue section and showed excellent agreement with histological staining of the kidney after MS imaging. Ifosfamide was analyzed in mouse kidney at 20 μm step size and was found to be accumulated in the inner medulla region. The identity of imatinib and ifosfamide was confirmed by on-tissue MS/MS measurements. All measurements including mass spectra from 10 μm pixels featured accurate mass (≤2 ppm root mean square) and mass resolving power of R = 30,000. Selected ion images were generated with a bin size of ∆m/z = 0.01 ensuring highly specific information. The ability of the method to cover larger areas was demonstrated by imaging a compound in the intestinal tract of a rat whole-body tissue section at 200 μm step size. The described method represents a major improvement in terms of spatial resolution and specificity for the analysis of drug compounds in tissue sections.},

   abstract = {Proteases have central roles in "life and death" processes due to their important ability to catalytically hydrolyze protein substrates, usually altering the function and/or activity of the target in the process. Knowledge of the substrate specificity of a protease should, in theory, dramatically improve the ability to predict target protein substrates. However, experimental identification and characterization of protease substrates is often difficult and time-consuming. Thus solving the "substrate identification" problem is fundamental to both understanding protease biology and the development of therapeutics that target specific protease-regulated pathways. In this context, bioinformatic prediction of protease substrates may provide useful and experimentally testable information about novel potential cleavage sites in candidate substrates. In this article, we provide an overview of recent advances in developing bioinformatic approaches for predicting protease substrate cleavage sites and identifying novel putative substrates. We discuss the advantages and drawbacks of the current methods and detail how more accurate models can be built by deriving multiple sequence and structural features of substrates. We also provide some suggestions about how future studies might further improve the accuracy of protease substrate specificity prediction.},

Because atherosclerosis-related cardiovascular diseases are the major complications of diabetes, it is important to determine the effect of DPP-4 inhibitors on atherosclerosis. In this study, nondiabetic and diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice were treated with DPP-4 inhibitor alogliptin for 24 weeks, and atherosclerotic lesions in aortic origins were examined. Results showed that diabetes significantly increased atherosclerotic lesions, but alogliptin treatment reduced atherosclerotic lesions in diabetic mice. Metabolic studies showed that diabetes increased plasma glucose and that alogliptin treatment reduced glucose. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry study showed that diabetes increased interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-1beta protein expression in atherosclerotic plaques, but alogliptin treatment attenuated diabetes-augmented IL-6 and IL-1beta expression. In consistence with the observations from the mouse models, our in vitro studies showed that alogliptin-inhibited toll-like receptor 4 (TLR-4)-mediated upregulation of IL-6, IL-1beta, and other proinflammatory cytokines by mononuclear cells. Taken together, our findings showed that alogliptin-inhibited atherosclerosis in diabetic apolipoprotein E-deficient mice and that the actions of alogliptin on both glucose and inflammation may contribute to the inhibition.},

   abstract = {A full description of the human proteome relies on the challenging task of detecting mature and changing forms of protein molecules in the body. Large-scale proteome analysis has routinely involved digesting intact proteins followed by inferred protein identification using mass spectrometry. This 'bottom-up' process affords a high number of identifications (not always unique to a single gene). However, complications arise from incomplete or ambiguous characterization of alternative splice forms, diverse modifications (for example, acetylation and methylation) and endogenous protein cleavages, especially when combinations of these create complex patterns of intact protein isoforms and species. 'Top-down' interrogation of whole proteins can overcome these problems for individual proteins, but has not been achieved on a proteome scale owing to the lack of intact protein fractionation methods that are well integrated with tandem mass spectrometry. Here we show, using a new four-dimensional separation system, identification of 1,043 gene products from human cells that are dispersed into more than 3,000 protein species created by post-translational modification (PTM), RNA splicing and proteolysis. The overall system produced greater than 20-fold increases in both separation power and proteome coverage, enabling the identification of proteins up to 105 kDa and those with up to 11 transmembrane helices. Many previously undetected isoforms of endogenous human proteins were mapped, including changes in multiply modified species in response to accelerated cellular ageing (senescence) induced by DNA damage. Integrated with the latest version of the Swiss-Prot database, the data provide precise correlations to individual genes and proof-of-concept for large-scale interrogation of whole protein molecules. The technology promises to improve the link between proteomics data and complex phenotypes in basic biology and disease research.},

   abstract = {Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) is a 28-amino acid neuropeptide which belongs to a glucagon/secretin superfamily, the ligand of class II G protein-coupled receptors. Knowledge for the conformation of VIP bound to membrane is important because the receptor activation is initiated by membrane binding of VIP. We have previously observed that VIP-G (glycine-extended VIP) is unstructured in solution, as evidenced by the limited NMR chemical shift dispersion. In this study, we determined the three-dimensional structures of VIP-G in two distinct membrane-mimicking environments. Although these are basically similar structures composed of a disordered N-terminal region and a long α-helix, micelle-bound VIP-G has a curved α-helix. The side chains of residues Phe6, Tyr10, Leu13, and Met17 found at the concave face form a hydrophobic patch in the micelle-bound state. The structural differences in two distinct membrane-mimicking environments show that the micelle-bound VIP-G localized at the water–micelle boundary with these side chains toward micelle interior. In micelle-bound PACAP-38 (one of the glucagon/secretin superfamily peptide) structure, the identical hydrophobic residues form the micelle-binding interface. This result suggests that these residues play an important role for the membrane binding of VIP and PACAP.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP4), DPP8, DPP9, and fibroblast activation protein (FAP), the four proteases of the DPP4 gene family, have unique peptidase and extra-enzymatic activities that have been implicated in various diseases including cancers. We report here a novel role of DPP9 in regulating cell survival and proliferation through modulating molecular signaling cascades. Akt (protein kinase B) activation was significantly inhibited by human DPP9 overexpression in human hepatoma cells (HepG2 and Huh7) and human embryonic kidney cells (HEK293T), whereas extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2) activity was unaffected, revealing a pathway-specific effect. Interestingly, the inhibitory effect of DPP9 on Akt pathway activation was growth factor dependent. DPP9 overexpression caused apoptosis and significantly less epidermal growth factor (EGF)-mediated Akt activation in HepG2 cells. However, such inhibitory effect was not observed in cells stimulated with other growth factors, including connective tissue growth factor, hepatic growth factor, insulin or platelet-derived growth factor-BB. The effect of DPP9 on Akt did not occur when DPP9 enzyme activity was ablated by either mutagenesis or inhibition. The phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt pathway is a major downstream effector of Ras. We found that DPP9 and DPP8, but not DPP4 or FAP, associate with H-Ras, a key signal molecule of the EGF receptor signaling pathway. These findings suggest an important signaling role of DPP9 in the regulation of survival and proliferation pathways.},

   abstract = {Human CD26 has dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP IV) enzyme activity and binds to adenosine deaminase (ADA). CD26 is costimulatory for lymphocytes and has a circulating soluble form (sCD26). DPP IV enzyme inhibition is a new successful type 2 diabetes therapy. We examined whether the ADA binding and catalytic functions of sCD26 contribute to its effects on T-cell proliferation. Wildtype soluble recombinant human CD26 (srhCD26), an enzyme inactive mutant (srhCD26E-) and an ADA non-binding mutant (srhCD26A-) were co-incubated in in vitro T-cell proliferation assays with peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) stimulated with phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), muromonab-CD3 or Herpes simplex virus antigen (HSV Ag). Both srhCD26 and srhCD26E- enhanced PHA-induced T-cell proliferation dose-dependently in all six subjects tested. srhCD26 and srhCD26A- had no overall effect on anti-CD3-stimulated PBMC proliferation in four of five subjects. srhCD26, srhCD26E- and srhCD26A- enhanced HSV Ag induced PBMC proliferation in low responders to HSV Ag, but had no effect or inhibited proliferation in HSV-high responders. Thus, effects of soluble human CD26 on human T-cell proliferation are mechanistically independent of both the enzyme activity and the ADA-binding capability of sCD26.},

   abstract = {Insulin and parathyroid hormone (PTH) regulate glucose metabolism in bone cells. In order to differentiate between the effects of these hormones and to compare the potency of insulin with that of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) I, we treated rat bone-derived osteoblastic (PyMS) cells for different time periods and at different concentrations with insulin, IGF I, or PTH, and measured [1-(14)C]-2-deoxy-D-glucose (2DG) uptake and incorporation of D-[U-(14)C] glucose into glycogen. 2DG uptake was Na-independent with an apparent affinity constant (K (M)) of ~2 mmol/l. Expression of the high affinity glucose transporters (GLUT), GLUT1 and GLUT3 but not of GLUT4, was found by Northern and Western analysis. Similar to the findings with primary rat osteoblasts, but distinct from those in rat fibroblasts, 2DG uptake and glycogen synthesis were increased in this cell line after exposure to low concentrations (0.1 nmol/l and above) of PTH. IGF I at low doses (0.3 nmol/l and above) or insulin at higher doses (1 nmol/l and above) stimulated 2DG uptake and [(3)H] thymidine incorporation into DNA. 2DG transport was enhanced already after 30 min of IGF I treatment whereas the effect of PTH became significant after 6 h. It is concluded that IGF I rather than insulin may be a physiological regulator of 2DG transport and glycogen synthesis in osteoblasts.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry-based proteomics is a powerful tool for identifying hundreds to thousands of posttranslational modifications in complex mixtures. However, it remains enormously challenging to simultaneously assess the intrinsic catalytic efficiencies (k(cat)/K(M)) of these modifications in the context of their natural interactors. Such fundamental enzymological constants are key to determining substrate specificity and for establishing the timing and importance of cellular signaling. Here, we report the use of selected reaction monitoring (SRM) for tracking proteolysis induced by human apoptotic caspases-3, -7, -8, and -9 in lysates and living cells. By following the appearance of the cleaved peptides in lysate as a function of time, we were able to determine hundreds of catalytic efficiencies in parallel. Remarkably, we find the rates of substrate hydrolysis for individual caspases vary greater than 500-fold indicating a sequential process. Moreover, the rank-order of substrate cutting is similar in apoptotic cells, suggesting that cellular structures do not dramatically alter substrate accessibility. Comparisons of extrinsic (TRAIL) and intrinsic (staurosporine) inducers of apoptosis revealed similar substrate profiles, suggesting the final proteolytic demolitions proceed by similarly ordered plans. Certain biological processes were rapidly targeted by the caspases, including multiple components of the endocyotic pathway and miRNA processing machinery. We believe this massively parallel and quantitative label-free approach to obtaining basic enzymological constants will facilitate the study of proteolysis and other posttranslational modifications in complex mixtures.},

   abstract = {Metformin, an oral anti-diabetic drug, is being considered increasingly for treatment and prevention of cancer, obesity as well as for the extension of healthy lifespan. Gradually accumulating discrepancies about its effect on cancer and obesity can be explained by the shortage of randomized clinical trials, differences between control groups (reference points), gender- and age-associated effects and pharmacogenetic factors. Studies of the potential antiaging effects of antidiabetic biguanides, such as metformin, are still experimental for obvious reasons and their results are currently ambiguous. Here we discuss whether the discrepancies in different studies are merely methodological or inherently related to individual differences in responsiveness to the drug.},

We are still far from achieving this goal due to limitations in analytical methodology and data analysis but also due to the fact that we surely have not discovered all amino acid modifications that occur in nature. To detect modified side chains and to discover new, still unknown amino acid derivatives, an understanding of the chemistry of the reactive groups of amino acids is mandatory. This tutorial focuses on the chemistry of the amino acid side chains and addresses non-enzymatic modifications. By highlighting some exemplary reactions a glimpse of the huge diversity of modified amino acids provides the reader with sufficient insight into amino acid chemistry to raise the awareness for unexpected side chain modifications. We further introduce the reader to a terminology, which enables the comprehensive description of the exact chemical composition of a protein species, including its full amino acid sequence and all modifications of its amino acid side chains.

   abstract = {Enhancement of hematopoietic recovery after radiation, chemotherapy, or hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) transplantation is clinically relevant. Dipeptidylpeptidase (DPP4) cleaves a wide variety of substrates, including the chemokine stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1). In the course of experiments showing that inhibition of DPP4 enhances SDF-1-mediated progenitor cell survival, ex vivo cytokine expansion and replating frequency, we unexpectedly found that DPP4 has a more general role in regulating colony-stimulating factor (CSF) activity. DPP4 cleaved within the N-termini of the CSFs granulocyte-macrophage (GM)-CSF, G-CSF, interleukin-3 (IL-3) and erythropoietin and decreased their activity. Dpp4 knockout or DPP4 inhibition enhanced CSF activities both in vitro and in vivo. The reduced activity of DPP4-truncated versus full-length human GM-CSF was mechanistically linked to effects on receptor-binding affinity, induction of GM-CSF receptor oligomerization and signaling capacity. Hematopoiesis in mice after radiation or chemotherapy was enhanced in Dpp4(-/-) mice or mice receiving an orally active DPP4 inhibitor. DPP4 inhibition enhanced engraftment in mice without compromising HSC function, suggesting the potential clinical utility of this approach.},

In the past decade, an enormous collective body of work has been done to develop and improve the imaging MS technology. This article gives a historical perspective, an overview of the principle and status of the technology and lists the main fields of applications. It also enumerates some of the critical challenges we need to collectively address for imaging MS to be considered a mainstream analytical method.},

   abstract = {To evaluate differences in analytical performance and clinical results of BNP and NT-proBNP immunoassays, a proficiency testing program, called CardioOrmoCheck study, has been organized since 2005 under the patronage of the Study Group of the Cardiovascular Biomarkers of the Italian Society of Clinical Biochemistry (SIBIOC). On average more than 100 Italian laboratories were involved in the annual 2005–2011 cycles. In total, 72 study samples were distributed and measured by participant laboratories for a total of 6706 results. A great difference in between-method variability was found between BNP (43.0 CV%) and NT-proBNP (8.7 CV%) immunoassays. However, with the only exception of the POCT method for BNP assay, all immunoassay methods showed an imprecision ≤ 10 CV% at the cut-off levels (i.e. 100 ng/L for BNP and 400 ng/L for NT-proBNP assay, respectively). Furthermore, CardioOrmoCheck study demonstrated that the most popular BNP immunoassays are affected by large systematic differences (on average more than 2 folds between TRIAGE Beckman-Coulter and ADVIA Centaur Siemens methods), while the agreement between NT-proBNP methods was better. CardioOrmoCheck study demonstrates that there are marked differences in analytical performance and measured values in particular among commercial methods for BNP assay. These findings suggest that it may be not reasonable to recommend identical cut-off or decision values for all BNP immunoassays.},

   abstract = {Targeted proteomics via selected reaction monitoring is a powerful mass spectrometric technique affording higher dynamic range, increased specificity and lower limits of detection than other shotgun mass spectrometry methods when applied to proteome analyses. However, it involves selective measurement of predetermined analytes, which requires more preparation in the form of selecting appropriate signatures for the proteins and peptides that are to be targeted. There is a growing number of software programs and resources for selecting optimal transitions and the instrument settings used for the detection and quantification of the targeted peptides, but the exchange of this information is hindered by a lack of a standard format. We have developed a new standardized format, called TraML, for encoding transition lists and associated metadata. In addition to introducing the TraML format, we demonstrate several implementations across the community, and provide semantic validators, extensive documentation, and multiple example instances to demonstrate correctly written documents. Widespread use of TraML will facilitate the exchange of transitions, reduce time spent handling incompatible list formats, increase the reusability of previously optimized transitions, and thus accelerate the widespread adoption of targeted proteomics via selected reaction monitoring.},

   abstract = {Vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) and pituitary adenylate cyclase-activating polypeptide (PACAP) are members of a superfamily of structurally related peptide hormones that includes glucagon, glucagon-like peptides, secretin, gastric inhibitory peptide (GIP) and growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH). VIP and PACAP exert their actions through three GPCRs - PAC(1) , VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) - belonging to class B (also referred to as class II, or secretin receptor-like GPCRs). This family comprises receptors for all peptides structurally related to VIP and PACAP, and also receptors for parathyroid hormone, corticotropin-releasing factor, calcitonin and related peptides. PAC(1) receptors are selective for PACAP, whereas VPAC(1) and VPAC(2) respond to both VIP and PACAP with high affinity. VIP and PACAP play diverse and important roles in the CNS, with functions in the control of circadian rhythms, learning and memory, anxiety and responses to stress and brain injury. Recent genetic studies also implicate the VPAC(2) receptor in susceptibility to schizophrenia and the PAC(1) receptor in post-traumatic stress disorder. In the periphery, VIP and PACAP play important roles in the control of immunity and inflammation, the control of pancreatic insulin secretion, the release of catecholamines from the adrenal medulla and as co-transmitters in autonomic and sensory neurons. This article, written by members of the International Union of Basic and Clinical Pharmacology Committee on Receptor Nomenclature and Drug Classification (NC-IUPHAR) subcommittee on receptors for VIP and PACAP, confirms the existing nomenclature for these receptors and reviews our current understanding of their structure, pharmacology and functions and their likely physiological roles in health and disease. More detailed information has been incorporated into newly revised pages in the IUPHAR database (http://www.iuphar-db.org/DATABASE/FamilyMenuForward?familyId=67).},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Inconsistent findings from observational studies have prolonged the controversy over the effects of history of diabetes mellitus (DM) on the risk of esophageal cancer (EC). We conducted a meta-analysis of epidemiologic studies to evaluate the association of a history of DM with the risk of EC. METHODS: We identified studies by a literature search of MEDLINE (from 1 January 1966) and EMBASE (from 1 January 1974), through 28 Feburary 2011, and by searching the reference lists of pertinent articles. Summary relative risks (SRRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated with a random-effects model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: A total of 17 studies (6 case-control studies and 11 cohort studies) fulfilled the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Compared with non-diabetic individuals, diabetic individuals had a modestly increased risk of EC (SRRs 1.30, 95% CI: 1.12-1.50), with significant heterogeneity among studies (p = 0.042). In stratified analysis, the SRRs of EC were 1.28 (1.10-1.49) for diabetic men and 1.07 (95% CI, 0.71-1.62) for diabetic women, respectively. In addition, DM was associated with an increased risk of esophageal adenocarcinoma (SRR 2.12, 95% CI 1.01-4.46). There was no significant publication bias (p = 0.127 for Begg's adjusted rank correlation test and p = 0.629 for Egger's regression test). CONCLUSION: These findings support the hypothesis that men with diabetes may have a modestly increased risk of EC, while diabetic women were not the case.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) as an analytical tool for bio-molecular and bio-medical research targets accurate compound localization and identification. In terms of dedicated instrumentation, this translates into the demand for more detail in the image dimension (spatial resolution) and in the spectral dimension (mass resolution and accuracy), preferably combined in one instrument. At the same time, large area biological tissue samples require fast acquisition schemes, instrument automation and a robust data infrastructure. This review discusses the analytical capabilities of an "ideal" MSI instrument for bio-molecular and bio-medical molecular imaging. The analytical attributes of such an ideal system are contrasted with technological and methodological challenges in MSI. In particular, innovative instrumentation for high spatial resolution imaging in combination with high sample throughput is discussed. Detector technology that targets various shortcomings of conventional imaging detector systems is highlighted. The benefits of accurate mass analysis, high mass resolving power, additional separation strategies and multimodal three-dimensional data reconstruction algorithms are discussed to provide the reader with an insight in the current technological advances and the potential of MSI for bio-medical research.},

Currently, several methods are available to determine protease substrate specificity based on approaches employing proteinogenic amino acids. The knowledge about the specificity of proteases can be significantly extended by application of structurally diverse families of non-proteinogenic amino acids. From a chemical point of view, this information may be used to design specific substrates, inhibitors, or activity-based probes, while biological functions of proteases, such as posttranslational modifications can also be investigated. In this review, we discuss current and prospective technologies for application of non-proteinogenic amino acids in protease substrate specificity profiling.},

   abstract = {Proteases recognize their endogenous substrates based largely on a sequence of proteinogenic amino acids that surrounds the cleavage site. Currently, several methods are available to determine protease substrate specificity based on approaches employing proteinogenic amino acids. The knowledge about the specificity of proteases can be significantly extended by application of structurally diverse families of non-proteinogenic amino acids. From a chemical point of view, this information may be used to design specific substrates, inhibitors, or activity-based probes, while biological functions of proteases, such as posttranslational modifications can also be investigated. In this review, we discuss current and prospective technologies for application of non-proteinogenic amino acids in protease substrate specificity profiling. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]

   abstract = {Abstract Fibroblast activation protein-α (FAP) is a serine protease that can provide target specificity to therapeutic agents because in adults its expression is restricted to pathologic sites, including cancer, fibrosis, arthritis, wounding, or inflammation. It is not expressed in most normal tissues. The majority of FAP is expressed by activated fibroblasts responding to the pathologic situations. FAP is typically found as a type II transmembrane protein physically attached to cells and with the bulk of the protein, including the catalytic domain, exposed to the extracellular space and accessible to small molecules. In this chapter, we review the structure, substrate specificities, signaling functions, and current design of FAP inhibitors. Evidence indicating the presence of FAP in multiple cancers, arthritis, fibrosis, keloids, and other pathologies is described and indicates possible roles for FAP in facilitating cell invasion and growth. Separate sections are devoted to the role of FAP in coordinating the stromal response to cancer, including a role in angiogenesis and a potential role in modulation of the antitumor immune response. Finally studies attempting to demonstrate the clinical potential of FAP are discussed, as well as some novel applications employing FAP in therapy or diagnosis. Throughout this review, effort is made to highlight areas where information is lacking and to highlight important questions that require further investigation.},

   abstract = {Metformin, one of most widely prescribed oral hypoglycemic agents, has recently received increased attention because of its potential antitumorigenic effects that are thought to be independent of its hypoglycemic effects. Several potential mechanisms have been suggested for the ability of metformin to suppress cancer growth in vitro and vivo: (1) activation of LKB1/AMPK pathway, (2) induction of cell cycle arrest and/or apoptosis, (3) inhibition of protein synthesis, (4) reduction in circulating insulin levels, (5) inhibition of the unfolded protein response (UPR), (6) activation of the immune system, and (7) eradication of cancer stem cells. There is also a growing number of evidence, mostly in the form of retrospective clinical studies that suggest that metformin may be associated with a decreased risk of developing cancer and with a better response to chemotherapy. There are currently several ongoing randomized clinical trials that incorporate metformin as an adjuvant to classic chemotherapy and aim to evaluate its potential benefits in this setting. This review highlights basic aspects of the molecular biology of metformin and summarizes new advances in basic science as well as intriguing results from recent clinical studies.},

   abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Ejaculation is a complex reflex mediated by a spinal ejaculation generator located in the lumbosacral spinal cord and consisting of a population of lumbar spinothalamic (LSt) neurons. LSt neurons and their intraspinal axonal projections contain several neuropeptides, including gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP). AIM: To test the hypothesis that GRP is critically involved in mediating ejaculation by acting in autonomic and motor areas of the lumbosacral spinal cord, utilizing a physiological paradigm to investigate ejaculatory reflexes in isolation of supraspinal inputs. METHODS: Dual immunohistochemistry for GRP and galanin was performed to investigate co-expression of GRP in LSt cells of control male rats. Next, anesthetized, spinalized male rats received intrathecal infusions of either GRP antagonist RC-3095 (0, 10, or 20 nmol/10 microL) or GRP (0, 0.2, 0.5 nmol/10 microL). Ejaculatory reflexes were induced by electrical stimulation of the dorsal penile nerve (DPN) which reliably triggers rhythmic increases in seminal vesicle pressure (SVP) and contractions of the bulbocavernosus muscle (BCM), indicative of the emission and expulsion phases of ejaculation, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: GRP in LSt cells was expressed as percentages of co-expression. SVP and electromyographic recording (EMG) of BCM activity following drug treatment and DPN stimulation were recorded and analyzed for numbers of SVP increases, BCM events and bursts. RESULTS: GRP was exclusively expressed in LSt cells and axons. Intrathecal infusion of RC-3095, but not saline, blocked SVP increases and BCM bursting induced by DPN stimulation. Intrathecal infusions of GRP, but not saline, triggered SVP increases and BCM bursting in 43-66% of animals and facilitated SVP increases and BCM bursting induced by subthreshold DPN stimulation in all animals. CONCLUSION: These data support a critical role for GRP for control of the emission and expulsion phases of ejaculation in male rats by acting in LSt target areas in the lumbosacral spinal cord.},

   abstract = {Protein termini provide critical insights into the functional state of individual proteins. With recent advances in specific proteomics approaches to enrich for N- and C-terminomes, the global analysis of whole terminomes at a proteome-wide scale is now possible. Information on the actual N- and C-termini of proteins in vivo and any post-translational modifications, including their generation by proteolytic processing, is rapidly accumulating. To access this information we present version 2.0 of TopFIND (http://clipserve.clip.ubc.ca/topfind), a knowledgebase for protein termini, terminus modifications and underlying proteolytic processing. Built on a protein-centric framework TopFIND covers five species: Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Arabidopsis thaliana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Escherichia coli and incorporates information from curated community submissions, publications, UniProtKB and MEROPS. Emphasis is placed on the detailed description and classification of evidence supporting the reported identification of each cleavage site, terminus and modification. A suite of filters can be applied to select supporting evidence. A dynamic network representation of the relationship between proteases, their substrates and inhibitors as well as visualization of protease cleavage site specificities complements the information displayed. Hence, TopFIND supports in depth investigation of protein termini information to spark new hypotheses on protein function by correlating cleavage events and termini with protein domains and mutations.},

   abstract = {Proteinases play critical roles in both intra and extracellular processes by binding and cleaving their protein substrates. The cleavage can either be non-specific as part of degradation during protein catabolism or highly specific as part of proteolytic cascades and signal transduction events. Identification of these targets is extremely challenging. Current computational approaches for predicting cleavage sites are very limited since they mainly represent the amino acid sequences as patterns or frequency matrices. In this work, we developed a novel predictor based on Random Forest algorithm (RF) using maximum relevance minimum redundancy (mRMR) method followed by incremental feature selection (IFS). The features of physicochemical/biochemical properties, sequence conservation, residual disorder, amino acid occurrence frequency, secondary structure and solvent accessibility were utilized to represent the peptides concerned. Here, we compared existing prediction tools which are available for predicting possible cleavage sites in candidate substrates with ours. It is shown that our method makes much more reliable predictions in terms of the overall prediction accuracy. In addition, this predictor allows the use of a wide range of proteinases.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Sitagliptin is an inhibitor of the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP-IV), which degrades the incretins, glucagon-like peptide-1 and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide, and thus, sitagliptin increases their bioavailability. The stimulation of insulin and the suppression of glucagon secretion that follow exert a glucose lowering effect and hence its use as an antidiabetic drug. Because DPP-IV is expressed as CD26 on cell membranes and because CD26 mediates proinflammatory signals, we hypothesized that sitagliptin may exert an antiinflammatory effect. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized to receive either 100 mg daily of sitagliptin or placebo for 12 wk. Fasting blood samples were obtained at baseline and at 2, 4, and 6 hours after a single dose of sitagliptin and at 2, 4, 8, and 12 wk of treatment. RESULTS: Glycosylated hemoglobin fell significantly from 7.6 +/- 0.4 to 6.9 +/- 3% in patients treated with sitagliptin. Fasting glucagon-like peptide-1 concentrations increased significantly, whereas the mRNA expression in mononuclear cell of CD26, the proinflammatory cytokine, TNFalpha, the receptor for endotoxin, Toll-like receptor (TLR)-4, TLR-2, and proinflammatory kinases, c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1 and inhibitory-kappaB kinase (IKKbeta), and that of the chemokine receptor CCR-2 fell significantly after 12 wk of sitagliptin. TLR-2, IKKbeta, CCR-2, and CD26 expression and nuclear factor-kappaB binding also fell after a single dose of sitagliptin. There was a fall in protein expression of c-Jun N-terminal kinase-1, IKKbeta, and TLR-4 and in plasma concentrations of C-reactive protein, IL-6, and free fatty acids after 12 wk of sitagliptin. CONCLUSIONS: These effects are consistent with a potent and rapid antiinflammatory effect of sitagliptin and may potentially contribute to the inhibition of atherosclerosis. The suppression of CD26 expression suggests that sitagliptin may inhibit the synthesis of DPP-IV in addition to inhibiting its action.},

   abstract = {MS imaging (MSI) is a remarkable new technology that enables us to determine the distribution of biological molecules present in tissue sections by direct ionization and detection. This technique is now widely used for in situ imaging of endogenous or exogenous molecules such as proteins, lipids, drugs and their metabolites, and it is a potential tool for pathological analysis and the investigation of disease mechanisms. MSI is also thought to be a technique that could be used for biomarker discovery with spatial information. The application of MSI to the study of endogenous metabolites has received considerable attention because metabolites are the result of the interactions of a system's genome with its environment and a total set of these metabolites more closely represents the phenotype of an organism under a given set of conditions. Recent studies have suggested the importance of in situ metabolite imaging in biological discovery and biomedical applications, but several issues regarding the technical application limits of MSI still remained to be resolved. In this review, we describe the capabilities of the latest MSI techniques for the imaging of endogenous metabolites in biological samples, and also discuss the technical problems and new challenges that need to be addressed for effective and widespread application of MSI in both preclinical and clinical settings.},

   abstract = {Physiological leukocyte homing and extravasation of leukocytes during inflammatory processes is directed by a number of proteins including adhesion molecules, proteases, cytokines and chemokines. Tight regulation of leukocyte migration is essential to ensure appropriate migration. A number of mechanisms exist that regulate leukocyte migration including up- or down-regulation of chemokine or chemokine receptor gene expression. However, chemokine availability in vivo also depends on the interaction of chemokines with specific glycosaminoglycans such as heparan sulfate on the surface of endothelial layers. Modification of the interaction of chemokines with these glycosaminoglycans alters the presentation of chemokines to chemokine receptors on circulating leukocytes. On top, binding of chemokines to atypical chemokine receptors that do not signal through G proteins affects chemokine availability on the endothelial layers. In addition to mechanisms that modulate chemokine availability, this review summarizes mechanisms that fine-tune chemokine function. These include synergy or antagonism between chemokines and alternative splicing of chemokine genes. Moreover, chemokines may be posttranslationally modified leading to molecules with enhanced or reduced potency to bind to G protein-coupled receptors or GAGs or generating chemokines with altered receptor specificity. Cross-talk between these different mechanisms generates a complex regulatory network that allows the organism to modulate leukocyte migration in a highly specific manner.},

   abstract = {BACKGROUND: Measuring disease and injury burden in populations requires a composite metric that captures both premature mortality and the prevalence and severity of ill-health. The 1990 Global Burden of Disease study proposed disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) to measure disease burden. No comprehensive update of disease burden worldwide incorporating a systematic reassessment of disease and injury-specific epidemiology has been done since the 1990 study. We aimed to calculate disease burden worldwide and for 21 regions for 1990, 2005, and 2010 with methods to enable meaningful comparisons over time. METHODS: We calculated DALYs as the sum of years of life lost (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs). DALYs were calculated for 291 causes, 20 age groups, both sexes, and for 187 countries, and aggregated to regional and global estimates of disease burden for three points in time with strictly comparable definitions and methods. YLLs were calculated from age-sex-country-time-specific estimates of mortality by cause, with death by standardised lost life expectancy at each age. YLDs were calculated as prevalence of 1160 disabling sequelae, by age, sex, and cause, and weighted by new disability weights for each health state. Neither YLLs nor YLDs were age-weighted or discounted. Uncertainty around cause-specific DALYs was calculated incorporating uncertainty in levels of all-cause mortality, cause-specific mortality, prevalence, and disability weights. FINDINGS: Global DALYs remained stable from 1990 (2.503 billion) to 2010 (2.490 billion). Crude DALYs per 1000 decreased by 23% (472 per 1000 to 361 per 1000). An important shift has occurred in DALY composition with the contribution of deaths and disability among children (younger than 5 years of age) declining from 41% of global DALYs in 1990 to 25% in 2010. YLLs typically account for about half of disease burden in more developed regions (high-income Asia Pacific, western Europe, high-income North America, and Australasia), rising to over 80% of DALYs in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1990, 47% of DALYs worldwide were from communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders, 43% from non-communicable diseases, and 10% from injuries. By 2010, this had shifted to 35%, 54%, and 11%, respectively. Ischaemic heart disease was the leading cause of DALYs worldwide in 2010 (up from fourth rank in 1990, increasing by 29%), followed by lower respiratory infections (top rank in 1990; 44% decline in DALYs), stroke (fifth in 1990; 19% increase), diarrhoeal diseases (second in 1990; 51% decrease), and HIV/AIDS (33rd in 1990; 351% increase). Major depressive disorder increased from 15th to 11th rank (37% increase) and road injury from 12th to 10th rank (34% increase). Substantial heterogeneity exists in rankings of leading causes of disease burden among regions. INTERPRETATION: Global disease burden has continued to shift away from communicable to non-communicable diseases and from premature death to years lived with disability. In sub-Saharan Africa, however, many communicable, maternal, neonatal, and nutritional disorders remain the dominant causes of disease burden. The rising burden from mental and behavioural disorders, musculoskeletal disorders, and diabetes will impose new challenges on health systems. Regional heterogeneity highlights the importance of understanding local burden of disease and setting goals and targets for the post-2015 agenda taking such patterns into account. Because of improved definitions, methods, and data, these results for 1990 and 2010 supersede all previously published Global Burden of Disease results. FUNDING: Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.},

   abstract = {CONTEXT: Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-4) inhibitors improve glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes. The underlying mechanisms (incretin effect, beta-cell function, endogenous glucose production) are not well known. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to examine mechanisms of the antihyperglycemic effect of DPP-4 inhibitors. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PATIENTS: We administered a mixed meal with glucose tracers ([6,6-(2)H(2)]-glucose infused, [1-(2)H]-glucose ingested), and on a separate day, a glucose infusion matched the glucose responses to the meal (isoglycemic test) in 50 type 2 diabetes patients (hemoglobin A(1c) = 7.4 +/- 0.8%) and seven controls; 47 diabetic completers were restudied after 6 wk. Glucose fluxes were calculated, and beta-cell function was assessed by mathematical modeling. The incretin effect was calculated as the ratio of oral to iv insulin secretion. INTERVENTION: We conducted a 6-wk, double-blind, randomized treatment with sitagliptin (100 mg/d; n = 25) or placebo (n = 22). RESULTS: Relative to placebo, meal-induced changes in fasting glucose and glucose area under the curve (AUC) were greater with sitagliptin, in parallel with a lower appearance of oral glucose [difference (post-pre) AUC = -353 +/- 915 vs. +146 +/- 601 mumol . kg(-1) . 5 h] and greater suppression of endogenous glucose production. Insulin sensitivity improved 10%, whereas total insulin secretion was unchanged. During the meal, beta-cell glucose sensitivity improved (+19[29] vs. 5[21] pmol . min(-1) . m(-2) . mm(-1); median [interquartile range]) and glucagon AUC decreased (19.6 +/- 7.5 to 17.3 +/- 7.1 ng . ml(-1) . 5 h), whereas intact glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide-1 AUC increased with sitagliptin vs. placebo. The incretin effect was unchanged because sitagliptin increased beta-cell glucose sensitivity also during the isoglycemic test. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic sitagliptin treatment improves glycemic control by lowering the appearance of oral glucose, postprandial endogenous glucose release, and glucagon response, and by improving insulin sensitivity and beta-cell glucose sensing in response to both oral and iv glucose.},

   abstract = {Oxyntomodulin (OXM) is a peptide secreted from the L cells of the gut following nutrient ingestion. OXM is a dual agonist of the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP1R) and the glucagon receptor (GCGR) combining the effects of GLP1 and glucagon to act as a potentially more effective treatment for obesity than GLP1R agonists. Injections of OXM in humans cause a significant reduction in weight and appetite, as well as an increase in energy expenditure. Activation of GCGR is classically associated with an elevation in glucose levels, which would be deleterious in patients with T2DM, but the antidiabetic properties of GLP1R agonism would be expected to counteract this effect. Indeed, OXM administration improved glucose tolerance in diet-induced obese mice. Thus, dual agonists of the GCGR and GLP1R represent a new therapeutic approach for diabetes and obesity with the potential for enhanced weight loss and improvement in glycemic control beyond those of GLP1R agonists.},

The MEROPS database (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk) aims to fulfil the need for an integrated source of information about these. The database has hierarchical classifications in which homologous sets of peptidases and protein inhibitors are grouped into protein species, which are grouped into families, which are in turn grouped into clans. The database has been expanded to include proteolytic enzymes other than peptidases. Special identifiers for peptidases from a variety of model organisms have been established so that orthologues can be detected in other species. A table of predicted active-site residue and metal ligand positions and the residue ranges of the peptidase domains in orthologues has been added to each peptidase summary. New displays of tertiary structures, which can be rotated or have the surfaces displayed, have been added to the structure pages. New indexes for gene names and peptidase substrates have been made available. Among the enhancements to existing features are the inclusion of small-molecule inhibitors in the tables of peptidase-inhibitor interactions, a table of known cleavage sites for each protein substrate, and tables showing the substrate-binding preferences of peptidases derived from combinatorial peptide substrate libraries.},

Porous silicon (pSi) chips are also suitable as support for mass spectrometry imaging (MSI). Here, we report an implementation of DIOS-MSI using the biosynthetic organs of a marine mollusc for proof of principle. The tissue section is stamped onto a fluorocarbon-functionalized pSi chip, which extracts and traps small hydrophobic molecules from the tissue under retention of their relative spatial distribution. The section is subsequently removed and the chip is imaged without any remaining tissue. We apply this novel tissue contact printing approach to investigate the distribution of biologically active brominated precursors to Tyrian purple in the hypobranchial gland of the marine mollusc, Dicathais orbita, using DIOS–MSI. The tissue contact printing is also compatible with other types of desorption/ionization surfaces, such as nanoassisted laser desorption/ionization (NALDI) targets.},

These changes include integration of in silico strategies for lead design and optimization that perform complementary roles to that of the traditional in vitro and in vivo approaches. The in silico models are facilitated by the availability of large datasets associated with high-throughput screening, bioinformatics algorithms to mine and annotate the data from a target perspective, and chemoinformatics methods to integrate chemistry methods into lead design process. This chapter highlights the applications of some of these methods and their limitations. We hope this serves as an introduction to in silico drug discovery.},

   abstract = {PURPOSE: Accumulating evidence suggests that metformin has antitumor activity. The aim of this study was to determine whether metformin use has a survival benefit in patients with pancreatic cancer. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective study of patients with diabetes and pancreatic cancer treated at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX). Information on diabetes history, including treatment modalities and clinical outcome of pancreatic cancer, was collected using personal interviews and medical record review. Survival analysis was carried out using a Kaplan-Meier plot, log-rank test, and Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Among the 302 patients identified, there were no significant differences in demographic or major clinical characteristics between the patients who had received metformin (n = 117) and those who had not (n = 185). The 2-year survival rate was 30.1% for the metformin group and 15.4% for the non-metformin group (P = 0.004; chi(2) test). The median overall survival time was 15.2 months for the metformin group, and 11.1 months for the non-metformin group (P = 0.004, log-rank test). Metformin users had a 32% lower risk of death; the HR (95% confidence interval) was 0.68 (0.52-0.89) in a univariate model (P = 0.004), 0.64 (0.48-0.86) after adjusting for other clinical predictors (P = 0.003), and 0.62 (0.44-0.87) after excluding insulin users (P = 0.006). Metformin use was significantly associated with longer survival in patients with nonmetastatic disease only. CONCLUSIONS: Our finding that metformin use was associated with improved outcome of patients with diabetes and pancreatic cancer should be confirmed in independent studies. Future research should prospectively evaluate metformin as a supplemental therapy in this population.},

Estimates are presented for selected chronic conditions and mental health characteristics, functional limitations, health status, health behaviors, health care access and utilization, and human immunodeficiency virus testing. Percentages and percent distributions are presented in both age-adjusted and unadjusted versions. DATA SOURCE: NHIS is a household, multistage probability sample survey conducted annually by interviewers of the U.S. Census Bureau for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's National Center for Health Statistics. In 2010, data were collected on 27,157 adults in the Sample Adult questionnaire. The conditional response rate was 77.3%, and the final response rate was 60.8%. The health information for adults in this report was obtained from one randomly selected adult per family. In very rare instances where the sample adult was not able to respond for himself or herself, a proxy was used. HIGHLIGHTS: In 2010, 61% of adults aged 18 years and over had excellent or very good health. Twelve percent of adults had been told by a doctor or health professional that they had heart disease, 25% had been told on two or more visits that they had hypertension, 9% had been told they had diabetes, and 22% had been told they had some form of arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis, gout, lupus, or fibromyalgia. Twenty-one percent of adults were current smokers, and 21% were former smokers. Based on estimates of body mass index, 35% of adults were overweight and 27% were obese.},

   abstract = {The ability to catalytically cleave protein substrates after synthesis is fundamental for all forms of life. Accordingly, site-specific proteolysis is one of the most important post-translational modifications. The key to understanding the physiological role of a protease is to identify its natural substrate(s). Knowledge of the substrate specificity of a protease can dramatically improve our ability to predict its target protein substrates, but this information must be utilized in an effective manner in order to efficiently identify protein substrates by in silico approaches. To address this problem, we present PROSPER, an integrated feature-based server for in silico identification of protease substrates and their cleavage sites for twenty-four different proteases. PROSPER utilizes established specificity information for these proteases (derived from the MEROPS database) with a machine learning approach to predict protease cleavage sites by using different, but complementary sequence and structure characteristics. Features used by PROSPER include local amino acid sequence profile, predicted secondary structure, solvent accessibility and predicted native disorder. Thus, for proteases with known amino acid specificity, PROSPER provides a convenient, pre-prepared tool for use in identifying protein substrates for the enzymes. Systematic prediction analysis for the twenty-four proteases thus far included in the database revealed that the features we have included in the tool strongly improve performance in terms of cleavage site prediction, as evidenced by their contribution to performance improvement in terms of identifying known cleavage sites in substrates for these enzymes. In comparison with two state-of-the-art prediction tools, PoPS and SitePrediction, PROSPER achieves greater accuracy and coverage. To our knowledge, PROSPER is the first comprehensive server capable of predicting cleavage sites of multiple proteases within a single substrate sequence using machine learning techniques.

It also confirmed that the in vivo treatment of tumor bearing mice with synthetic supplement containing phosphoethanolamine (PHO-S) promoted an accentuated decrease in relative abundance of the tumor biomarkers. NALDI-MS imaging is a matrix-free LDI protocol based on the selective imprinting of lipids in the NALDI plate followed by the removal of the tissue. It therefore provides good quality and selective chemical images with preservation of spatial distribution and less interference from tissue material.

   abstract = {The new incretin-based therapies, dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) inhibitors and glucagon like peptide 1 (GLP1) receptor agonists are widely used for the treatment of type 2 diabetes because of their glucose-lowering capacity with low risk of hypoglycemia. As they are weight neutral or induce weight loss in this mostly overweight population, they are popular among clinicians and patients alike. Nonetheless, concerns have been raised about GLP1's trophic effects. While increased beta cell mass observed in rodents sounds appealing for treatment of diabetes, there was also an increased incidence of medullary thyroid cancer (MTC) in some species. We reviewed literature available in the Medline database until March 2012. Safety signals have emerged for MTC and pancreatic carcinoma from adverse event databases in the United States and Europe. Considering the relatively short duration of these studies, it is more likely that premalignant lesions are stimulated in presence of GLP1, rather than new neoplasms induced. Moreover, interpreting results of animal studies is difficult because of species-specific differences in presence and density of GLP1 receptors. Furthermore, data are emerging suggesting beneficial effects of GLP1 on colon and breast cancer. In conclusion, presently, the benefits of using DPP4 inhibitors or GLP1 receptor agonists for treatment of type 2 diabetes outweigh the risks. Nonetheless, their safety profile should be monitored and their indications should be widened cautiously. At present they remain contra-indicated in patients with a personal or family history of MTC or multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2.},

   abstract = {Proteomics is very much a technology-driven field. The ambition is to identify, quantify and to assess the state of posttranslational modification and interaction partners for every protein in the cell. The proteome is in a state of flux and is thus extremely complex. Analysis of the proteome is exacerbated by the huge dynamic concentration range of proteins in the cellular environment. The impact that mass spectrometry-based proteomics has had on the field of biology has heavily depended on dramatic improvements in mass spectrometry that have been made in recent years. We examined 1541 reports indexed in PubMed relating to proteomics and reproduction to identify trends in the field and to make some broad observations for future work. To set the scene, in the first part of the report, we give a comprehensive overview of proteomics and associated techniques and technologies (such as separations and mass spectrometry). The second part examines the field in light of these techniques and suggests some opportunities for application of these tools in the area of reproduction.},

   abstract = {Due to its prevalence, obesity is now considered a global epidemic. It is linked to increased risk of colorectal cancer, the third most common cancer and the second leading cause of death among adults in Western countries. Obese adipose tissue differs from lean adipose tissue in its immunogenic profile, body fat distribution and metabolic profile. Obese adipose tissue releases free fatty acids, adipokines and many pro-inflammatory chemokines. These factors are known to play a key role in regulating malignant transformation and cancer progression. Obese adipose tissue is infiltrated by macrophages that participate in inflammatory pathways activated within the tissue. Adipose tissue macrophages consist of two different phenotypes. M1 macrophages reside in obese adipose tissue and produce pro-inflammatory cytokines, and M2 macrophages reside in lean adipose tissue and produce anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-10 (IL-10). The metabolic networks that confer tumour cells with their oncogenic properties, such as increased proliferation and the ability to avoid apoptosis are still not well understood. We review the interactions between adipocytes and immune cells that may alter the metabolism towards promotion of colorectal cancer.},

   abstract = {Colorectal cancer (CRC) is the third most commonly diagnosed cancer in the United States after cancers of the lung and the breast/prostate. While the incidence of CRC in the United States is among the highest in the world (approximately 52/100,000), its incidence in countries in India is among the lowest (approximately 7/100,000), suggesting that lifestyle factors may play a role in development of the disease. Whereas obesity, excessive alcohol consumption, a high-calorie diet, and a lack of physical activity promote this cancer, evidence indicates that foods containing folates, selenium, Vitamin D, dietary fiber, garlic, milk, calcium, spices, vegetables, and fruits are protective against CRC in humans. Numerous agents from "mother nature" (also called "nutraceuticals,") that have potential to both prevent and treat CRC have been identified. The most significant discoveries relate to compounds such as cardamonin, celastrol, curcumin, deguelin, diosgenin, thymoquinone, tocotrienol, ursolic acid, and zerumbone. Unlike pharmaceutical drugs, these agents modulate multiple targets, including transcription factors, growth factors, tumor cell survival factors, inflammatory pathways, and invasion and angiogenesis linked closely to CRC. We describe the potential of these dietary agents to suppress the growth of human CRC cells in culture and to inhibit tumor growth in animal models. We also describe clinical trials in which these agents have been tested for efficacy in humans. Because of their safety and affordability, these nutraceuticals provide a novel opportunity for treatment of CRC, an "old age" disease with an "age old" solution.},

   abstract = {During inflammation, vascular permeability is increased by various proteolytic events, such as the generation of bradykinin, that augment local tissue responses by enabling tissue penetration of serum proteins, including complement and acute-phase proteins. Proteases also govern inflammatory responses by processing extracellular matrix proteins and soluble bioactive mediators. We quantified changes in the proteome and the nature of protein amino termini (the N-terminome) and the altered abundance of murine proteases and inhibitors during skin inflammation. Through analysis of the N-terminome by iTRAQ-TAILS, we identified cotranslational and posttranslational alphaN-acetylation motifs, quantitative increases in protein abundance, and qualitative changes in the proteolytic signature during inflammation. Of the proteins identified in normal skin, about half were cleaved, and phorbol ester-induced inflammation increased the proportion of cleaved proteins, including chemokines and complement proteins, that were processed at previously uncharacterized sites. In response to phorbol ester-induced inflammation, mice deficient in matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP2) showed reduced accumulation of serum proteins in the skin and exhibited different proteolytic networks from those of wild-type mice. We found that the complement 1 (C1) inhibitor attenuated the increase in serum protein accumulation in inflamed skin. Cleavage and inactivation of the C1 inhibitor by MMP2 increased complement activation and bradykinin generation in wild-type mice, leading to increased vessel permeability during inflammation, which was diminished in Mmp2(-/-) mice. Thus, our systems-level analysis of proteolysis dissected cleavage events associated with skin inflammation and demonstrated that loss of a single protease could perturb the proteolytic signaling network and enhance inflammation.},

Activation of GLP-1 and GIP receptors also leads to nonglycemic effects in multiple tissues, through direct actions on tissues expressing incretin receptors and indirect mechanisms mediated through neuronal and endocrine pathways. Here we contrast the pharmacology and physiology of incretin hormones and review recent advances in mechanisms coupling incretin receptor signaling to pleiotropic metabolic actions in preclinical studies. We discuss whether mechanisms identified in preclinical studies have potential translational relevance for the treatment of human disease and highlight controversies and uncertainties in incretin biology that require resolution in future studies.},

   abstract = {We here present The Online Protein Processing Resource (TOPPR; http://iomics.ugent.be/toppr/), an online database that contains thousands of published proteolytically processed sites in human and mouse proteins. These cleavage events were identified with COmbinded FRActional DIagonal Chromatography proteomics technologies, and the resulting database is provided with full data provenance. Indeed, TOPPR provides an interactive visual display of the actual fragmentation mass spectrum that led to each identification of a reported processed site, complete with fragment ion annotations and search engine scores. Apart from warehousing and disseminating these data in an intuitive manner, TOPPR also provides an online analysis platform, including methods to analyze protease specificity and substrate-centric analyses. Concretely, TOPPR supports three ways to retrieve data: (i) the retrieval of all substrates for one or more cellular stimuli or assays; (ii) a substrate search by UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot accession number, entry name or description; and (iii) a motif search that retrieves substrates matching a user-defined protease specificity profile. The analysis of the substrates is supported through the presence of a variety of annotations, including predicted secondary structure, known domains and experimentally obtained 3D structure where available. Across substrates, substrate orthologs and conserved sequence stretches can also be shown, with iceLogo visualization provided for the latter.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To review the most recent clinical data on the safety and efficacy of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors and to evaluate their position in current treatment guidelines and algorithms. METHODS: PubMed searches were performed to identify published data regarding both the safety and efficacy of DPP-4 inhibitors approved for use in the United States and clinical guidelines describing recommendations for their use. RESULTS: In the past 2 years, more than 100 publications have added clinical trial data on DPP-4 inhibitors to the medical literature. Since becoming available in 2006, these agents have demonstrated an excellent safety/tolerability profile, and as add-on to metformin, DPP-4 inhibitors may have comparable glycemic efficacy as other oral agents. As a result, DPP-4 inhibitors have assumed roles in clinical practice guidelines and treatment algorithms that are comparable to the sulfonylurea class. Advantages of DPP-4 inhibitors include an oral route of administration, a mechanism of action based on glucose-stimulated insulin secretion, and a low risk of hypoglycemia. The main disadvantage associated with this class is a relatively high cost. There is also less clinical experience with DPP-4 agents than classes of agents that have been in use for decades; however, long-term data on the safety and efficacy of DPP-4 agents will be available in the near future to refine their place in therapy. From 2 large clinical trials recently reported, EXAMINE and SAVOR, this class of agents does not increase overall adverse cardiovascular outcomes nor the risk of pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer. CONCLUSION: Based on comparisons of nonglycemic effects such as risk of hypoglycemia, weight gain, and durability, DPP-4 inhibitors may be considered as an alternative to sulfonylureas. However, direct cost may be a determining factor in the choice of therapy.},

We found that the Rap guanine nucleotide exchange factor Rapgef2 was enriched from primary bovine neuroendocrine cells by cAMP-agarose affinity chromatography and that it was specifically eluted by cAMP. With loss-of-function experiments in the rat neuronal cell line Neuroscreen-1 (NS-1) and gain-of-function experiments in human embryonic kidney 293T cells, we demonstrated that Rapgef2 connected GPCR-dependent activation of adenylate cyclase and increased cAMP concentration with the activation of ERK in neurons and endocrine cells. Furthermore, knockdown of Rapgef2 blocked cAMP- and ERK-dependent neuritogenesis. Our data are consistent with a pathway involving the cAMP-mediated activation of Rapgef2, which then stimulates Rap1, leading to increases in B-Raf, MEK, and ERK activity.},

   abstract = {The 20th annual Database Issue of Nucleic Acids Research includes 176 articles, half of which describe new online molecular biology databases and the other half provide updates on the databases previously featured in NAR and other journals. This year’s highlights include two databases of DNA repeat elements; several databases of transcriptional factors and transcriptional factor-binding sites; databases on various aspects of protein structure and protein–protein interactions; databases for metagenomic and rRNA sequence analysis; and four databases specifically dedicated to Escherichia coli. The increased emphasis on using the genome data to improve human health is reflected in the development of the databases of genomic structural variation (NCBI’s dbVar and EBI’s DGVa), the NIH Genetic Testing Registry and several other databases centered on the genetic basis of human disease, potential drugs, their targets and the mechanisms of protein–ligand binding. Two new databases present genomic and RNAseq data for monkeys, providing wealth of data on our closest relatives for comparative genomics purposes. The NAR online Molecular Biology Database Collection, available at http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/a/, has been updated and currently lists 1512 online databases. The full content of the Database Issue is freely available online on the Nucleic Acids Research website (http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/).},

   abstract = {A purely information theory-guided approach to quantitatively characterize protease specificity is established. We calculate an entropy value for each protease subpocket based on sequences of cleaved substrates extracted from the MEROPS database. We compare our results with known subpocket specificity profiles for individual proteases and protease groups (e.g. serine proteases, metallo proteases) and reflect them quantitatively. Summation of subpocket-wise cleavage entropy contributions yields a measure for overall protease substrate specificity. This total cleavage entropy allows ranking of different proteases with respect to their specificity, separating unspecific digestive enzymes showing high total cleavage entropy from specific proteases involved in signaling cascades. The development of a quantitative cleavage entropy score allows an unbiased comparison of subpocket-wise and overall protease specificity. Thus, it enables assessment of relative importance of physicochemical and structural descriptors in protease recognition. We present an exemplary application of cleavage entropy in tracing substrate specificity in protease evolution. This highlights the wide range of substrate promiscuity within homologue proteases and hence the heavy impact of a limited number of mutations on individual substrate specificity.},

   abstract = {The antidiabetic drug Metformin causes weight loss in both diabetic and non-diabetic individuals. Metformin treatment is also associated with lower circulating levels of the orexigenic hormone ghrelin. To test whether Metformin directly affects ghrelin cells, rat primary stomach cells were treated with Metformin and the levels of ghrelin secretion, proghrelin gene expression and activation of adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) were examined. Metformin significantly reduced ghrelin secretion and proghrelin mRNA production and both these effects were blocked by co-incubation with the AMPK inhibitor compound C. Furthermore, the AMPK activator 5-amino-1-beta-D-ribofuranosyl-imidazole-4-carboxamide (AICAR) significantly inhibited ghrelin secretion. Additionally, ghrelin cells were shown to express AMPK. Finally, Metformin treatment caused a significant increase in the level of phosphorylated (active) AMPK. Our results show that Metformin directly inhibits stomach ghrelin production and secretion through AMPK. This reduction in ghrelin secretion may be one of the key components in Metformin's mechanism of weight loss.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has proven to be extremely useful for applications such as the spatial analysis of peptides and proteins in biological tissue, the performance assessment of drugs in vivo or the measurement of protein or metabolite expression as tissue classifiers or biomarkers from disease versus control tissue comparisons. The most popular MSI technique is MALDI mass spectrometry. First invented by Richard Caprioli in the mid-1990s, it is the highest performing MSI technique in terms of spatial resolution, sensitivity for intact biomolecules and application range today. The unique ability to identify and spatially resolve numerous compounds simultaneously, based on m/z values has inter alia been applied to untargeted and targeted chemical mapping of biological compartments, revealing changes of physiological states, disease pathologies and metabolic faith and distribution of xenobiotics. Many MSI applications focus on lipid species because of the lipids' diverse roles as structural components of cell membranes, their function in the surfactant cycle, and their involvement as second messengers in signalling cascades of tissues and cells. This article gives a comprehensive overview of lipid imaging techniques and applications using established MALDI and SIMS methods but also other promising MSI techniques such as DESI.},

   abstract = {Until recently, understanding the regulatory behavior of cells has been pursued through independent analysis of the transcriptome or the proteome. Based on the central dogma, it was generally assumed that there exist a direct correspondence between mRNA transcripts and generated protein expressions. However, recent studies have shown that the correlation between mRNA and Protein expressions can be low due to various factors such as different half lives and post transcription machinery. Thus, a joint analysis of the transcriptomic and proteomic data can provide useful insights that may not be deciphered from individual analysis of mRNA or protein expressions. This article reviews the existing major approaches for joint analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data. We categorize the different approaches into eight main categories based on the initial algorithm and final analysis goal. We further present analogies with other domains and discuss the existing research problems in this area. ©2013 Bentham Science Publishers.},

   abstract = {The colony stimulating factors (CSFs), granulocyte macrophage-CSF (GM-CSF), macrophage-CSF (M-CSF or CSF-1) and granulocyte-CSF (G-CSF) were first identified as in vitro hematopoietic growth factors. They have since been shown to regulate myeloid cell numbers and function at steady state and during inflammation. Preclinical data suggest that targeting CSFs might be beneficial in autoimmune and inflammatory disease, and manipulation of CSF biology is now being tested in clinical trials. Here, we examine recent insights into CSF function, at steady state and during pathology, as provided by CSF or CSF receptor neutralization/deletion studies or from CSF administration. We discuss controversies regarding the role of CSFs in controlling specific myeloid cell populations and highlight how the newly identified M-CSF receptor ligand, interleukin (IL)-34, is necessitating a reassessment of the field.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) is a membrane-associated peptidase, also known as CD26. DPP-4 has widespread organ distribution throughout the body and exerts pleiotropic effects via its peptidase activity. A representative target peptide is glucagon-like peptide-1, and inactivation of glucagon-like peptide-1 results in the development of glucose intolerance/diabetes mellitus and hepatic steatosis. In addition to its peptidase activity, DPP-4 is known to be associated with immune stimulation, binding to and degradation of extracellular matrix, resistance to anti-cancer agents, and lipid accumulation. The liver expresses DPP-4 to a high degree, and recent accumulating data suggest that DPP-4 is involved in the development of various chronic liver diseases such as hepatitis C virus infection, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Furthermore, DPP-4 occurs in hepatic stem cells and plays a crucial role in hepatic regeneration. In this review, we described the tissue distribution and various biological effects of DPP-4. Then, we discussed the impact of DPP-4 in chronic liver disease and the possible therapeutic effects of a DPP-4 inhibitor.},

The unique chemistry and location of alpha-amino-termini and carboxyl-termini in a protein engender special chemical and physical properties to a protein. Hence, modification of protein termini is often associated with new biological activities of a protein. We highlight recent proteomic developments enabling high throughput identification of protein termini.

   abstract = {Protein modification is an extremely important post-translational regulation that adjusts the physical and chemical properties, conformation, stability and activity of a protein; thus altering protein function. Due to the high throughput of mass spectrometry (MS)-based methods in identifying site-specific post-translational modifications (PTMs), dbPTM (http://dbPTM.mbc.nctu.edu.tw/) is updated to integrate experimental PTMs obtained from public resources as well as manually curated MS/MS peptides associated with PTMs from research articles. Version 3.0 of dbPTM aims to be an informative resource for investigating the substrate specificity of PTM sites and functional association of PTMs between substrates and their interacting proteins. In order to investigate the substrate specificity for modification sites, a newly developed statistical method has been applied to identify the significant substrate motifs for each type of PTMs containing sufficient experimental data. According to the data statistics in dbPTM, >60% of PTM sites are located in the functional domains of proteins. It is known that most PTMs can create binding sites for specific protein-interaction domains that work together for cellular function. Thus, this update integrates protein–protein interaction and domain–domain interaction to determine the functional association of PTM sites located in protein-interacting domains. Additionally, the information of structural topologies on transmembrane (TM) proteins is integrated in dbPTM in order to delineate the structural correlation between the reported PTM sites and TM topologies. To facilitate the investigation of PTMs on TM proteins, the PTM substrate sites and the structural topology are graphically represented. Also, literature information related to PTMs, orthologous conservations and substrate motifs of PTMs are also provided in the resource. Finally, this version features an improved web interface to facilitate convenient access to the resource.},

   abstract = {The newly emergent Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) can cause severe pulmonary disease in humans, representing the second example of a highly pathogenic coronavirus, the first being SARS-CoV. CD26 (also known as dipeptidyl peptidase 4, DPP4) was recently identified as the cellular receptor for MERS-CoV. The engagement of the MERS-CoV spike protein with CD26 mediates viral attachment to host cells and virus-cell fusion, thereby initiating infection. Here we delineate the molecular basis of this specific interaction by presenting the first crystal structures of both the free receptor binding domain (RBD) of the MERS-CoV spike protein and its complex with CD26. Furthermore, binding between the RBD and CD26 is measured using real-time surface plasmon resonance with a dissociation constant of 16.7 nM. The viral RBD is composed of a core subdomain homologous to that of the SARS-CoV spike protein, and a unique strand-dominated external receptor binding motif that recognizes blades IV and V of the CD26 beta-propeller. The atomic details at the interface between the two binding entities reveal a surprising protein-protein contact mediated mainly by hydrophilic residues. Sequence alignment indicates, among betacoronaviruses, a possible structural conservation for the region homologous to the MERS-CoV RBD core, but a high variation in the external receptor binding motif region for virus-specific pathogenesis such as receptor recognition.},

   abstract = {Bone is permanently remodeled by a complex network of local, hormonal, and neuronal factors that affect osteoclast and osteoblast biology. Among these factors, a role for gastrointestinal hormones has been proposed based on the evidence that bone resorption dramatically falls after a meal. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP1) is one of these gut hormones, and despite several reports suggesting an anabolic effect of GLP1, or its stable analogs, on bone mass, little is known about the effects of GLP1/GLP1 receptor on bone strength. In this study, we investigated by three-point bending, quantitative X-ray microradiography, microcomputed tomography, qBEI, and FTIRI bone strength and bone quality in male Glp1r knockout (Glp1r KO) mice when compared with control WT animals. Animals with a deletion of Glp1r presented with a significant reduction in ultimate load, yield load, stiffness, and total absorbed and post-yield energies when compared with WT animals. Furthermore, cortical thickness and bone outer diameter were significantly decreased in deficient animals. The mineral quantity and quality were not significantly different between Glp1r KO and WT animals. On the other hand, the maturity of the collagen matrix was significantly reduced in deficient animals and associated with lowered material properties. Taken together, these data support a positive effect of GLP1R on bone strength and quality.},

   abstract = {An increasing number of studies involve integrative analysis of gene and protein expression data, taking advantage of new technologies such as next-generation transcriptome sequencing and highly sensitive mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation. Recently, a strategy, termed ribosome profiling (or RIBO-seq), based on deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments, indirectly monitoring protein synthesis, has been described. We devised a proteogenomic approach constructing a custom protein sequence search space, built from both Swiss-Prot- and RIBO-seq-derived translation products, applicable for MS/MS spectrum identification. To record the impact of using the constructed deep proteome database, we performed two alternative MS-based proteomic strategies as follows: (i) a regular shotgun proteomic and (ii) an N-terminal combined fractional diagonal chromatography (COFRADIC) approach. Although the former technique gives an overall assessment on the protein and peptide level, the latter technique, specifically enabling the isolation of N-terminal peptides, is very appropriate in validating the RIBO-seq-derived (alternative) translation initiation site profile. We demonstrate that this proteogenomic approach increases the overall protein identification rate 2.5% (e.g. new protein products, new protein splice variants, single nucleotide polymorphism variant proteins, and N-terminally extended forms of known proteins) as compared with only searching UniProtKB-SwissProt. Furthermore, using this custom database, identification of N-terminal COFRADIC data resulted in detection of 16 alternative start sites giving rise to N-terminally extended protein variants besides the identification of four translated upstream ORFs. Notably, the characterization of these new translation products revealed the use of multiple near-cognate (non-AUG) start codons. As deep sequencing techniques are becoming more standard, less expensive, and widespread, we anticipate that mRNA sequencing and especially custom-tailored RIBO-seq will become indispensable in the MS-based protein or peptide identification process. The underlying mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium with the dataset identifier PXD000124.},

Recently, these efforts have culminated in quantitative measurements of the number of copies per cell for most expressed proteins in organisms ranging from bacteria to mammalian cells. Here, we estimate the expected total number of proteins per unit of cell volume using known parameters related to the composition of cells such as the fraction of cell mass that is protein, and the average protein length. Using simple arguments, we estimate a range of 2-4 million proteins per cubic micron (i.e. 1 fL) in bacteria, yeast, and mammalian cells. Interestingly, we find that measured values that are reported for fission yeast and mammalian cells are often about 3-10 times lower. We discuss this apparent discrepancy and how to use the estimate as benchmark to recalibrate proteome-wide quantitative censuses or to revisit assumptions about cell composition.},

   abstract = {The workshop “Bioinformatics for Biotechnology Applications (HavanaBioinfo 2012)”, held December 8–11, 2012 in Havana, aimed at exploring new bioinformatics tools and approaches for large-scale proteomics, genomics and chemoinformatics. Major conclusions of the workshop include the following: (i) development of new applications and bioinformatics tools for proteomic repository analysis is crucial; current proteomic repositories contain enough data (spectra/identifications) that can be used to increase the annotations in protein databases and to generate new tools for protein identification; (ii) spectral libraries, de novo sequencing and database search tools should be combined to increase the number of protein identifications; (iii) protein probabilities and FDR are not yet sufficiently mature; (iv) computational proteomics software needs to become more intuitive; and at the same time appropriate education and training should be provided to help in the efficient exchange of knowledge between mass spectrometrists and experimental biologists and bioinformaticians in order to increase their bioinformatics background, especially statistics knowledge.},

   abstract = {Cancers develop in complex tissue environments, which they depend on for sustained growth, invasion and metastasis. Unlike tumor cells, stromal cell types within the tumor microenvironment (TME) are genetically stable and thus represent an attractive therapeutic target with reduced risk of resistance and tumor recurrence. However, specifically disrupting the pro-tumorigenic TME is a challenging undertaking, as the TME has diverse capacities to induce both beneficial and adverse consequences for tumorigenesis. Furthermore, many studies have shown that the microenvironment is capable of normalizing tumor cells, suggesting that re-education of stromal cells, rather than targeted ablation per se, may be an effective strategy for treating cancer. Here we discuss the paradoxical roles of the TME during specific stages of cancer progression and metastasis, as well as recent therapeutic attempts to re-educate stromal cells within the TME to have anti-tumorigenic effects.},

   abstract = {Most human coronaviruses cause mild upper respiratory tract disease but may be associated with more severe pulmonary disease in immunocompromised individuals'. However, SARS coronavirus caused severe lower respiratory disease with nearly 10% mortality and evidence of systemic spread(2). Recently, another coronavirus (human coronavirus-Erasmus Medical Center (hCoV-EMC)) was identified in patients with severe and sometimes lethal lower respiratory tract infection(3,4). Viral genome analysis revealed close relatedness to coronaviruses found in bats'. Here we identify dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4; also known as CD26) as a functional receptor for hCoV-EMC. DPP4 specifically co-purified with the receptor-binding Si domain of the hCoV-EMC spike protein from lysates of susceptible Huh-7 cells. Antibodies directed against DPP4 inhibited hCoV-EMC infection of primary human bronchial epithelial cells and Huh-7 cells. Expression of human and bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) DPP4 in non-susceptible COS-7 cells enabled infection by hCoV-EMC. The use of the evolutionarily conserved DPP4 protein from different species as a functional receptor provides clues about the host range potential of hCoV-EMC. In addition, it will contribute critically to our understanding of the pathogenesis and epidemiology of this emerging human coronavirus, and may facilitate the development of intervention strategies.},

   abstract = {Steady improvements in proteomics present a bioinformatic challenge to retrieve, store, and process the accumulating and often redundant amount of information. In particular, a large-scale comparison and analysis of protein-protein interaction (PPI) data requires tools for data interpretation as well as validation. At this juncture, the Protein Interaction and Molecule Search (PRIMOS) platform represents a novel web portal that unifies six primary PPI databases (BIND, Biomolecular Interaction Network Database; DIP, Database of Interacting Proteins; HPRD, Human Protein Reference Database; IntAct; MINT, Molecular Interaction Database; and MIPS, Munich Information Center for Protein Sequences) into a single consistent repository, which currently includes more than 196,700 redundancy-removed PPIs. PRIMOS supports three advanced search strategies centering on disease-relevant PPIs, on inter- and intra-organismal crosstalk relations (e.g., pathogen-host interactions), and on highly connected protein nodes analysis ("hub" identification). The main novelties distinguishing PRIMOS from other secondary PPI databases are the reassessment of known PPIs, and the capacity to validate personal experimental data by our peer-reviewed, homology-based validation. This article focuses on definite PRIMOS use cases (presentation of embedded biological concepts, example applications) to demonstrate its broad functionality and practical value. PRIMOS is publicly available at http://primos.fh-hagenberg.at.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS) imaging links molecular information and the spatial distribution of analytes within a sample. In contrast to most histochemical techniques, mass spectrometry imaging can differentiate molecular modifications and does not require labeling of targeted compounds. We have recently introduced the first mass spectrometry imaging method that provides highly specific molecular information (high resolution and accuracy in mass) at cellular dimensions (high resolution in space). This method is based on a matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) imaging source working at atmospheric pressure which is coupled to an orbital trapping mass spectrometer. Here, we present a number of application examples and demonstrate the benefit of 'mass spectrometry imaging with high resolution in mass and space.' Phospholipids, peptides and drug compounds were imaged in a number of tissue samples at a spatial resolution of 5-10 mum. Proteins were analyzed after on-tissue tryptic digestion at 50-mum resolution. Additional applications include the analysis of single cells and of human lung carcinoma tissue as well as the first MALDI imaging measurement of tissue at 3 mum pixel size. MS image analysis for all these experiments showed excellent correlation with histological staining evaluation. The high mass resolution (R = 30,000) and mass accuracy (typically 1 ppm) proved to be essential for specific image generation and reliable identification of analytes in tissue samples. The ability to combine the required high-quality mass analysis with spatial resolution in the range of single cells is a unique feature of our method. With that, it has the potential to supplement classical histochemical protocols and to provide new insights about molecular processes on the cellular level.},

Here, we examined the effect of sitagliptin, a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitor, on systemic inflammation and pro-inflammatory (M1)/anti-inflammatory (M2)-like phenotypes of peripheral blood monocytes in diabetic patients. Methods Forty-eight type 2 diabetic patients were divided into the following two groups: sitagliptin-treatment (50 mg daily for 3 months) (n = 24) and untreated control (n = 24) groups. Measurements were undertaken to assess changes in glucose-lipid metabolism, serum levels of inflammatory cytokines such as serum amyloid A-LDL (SAA-LDL), C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α). Furthermore, the effects of sitagliptin treatment on M1/M2-like phenotypes in peripheral blood monocytes were examined. Results Treatment with sitagliptin significantly decreased fasting plasma glucose, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), serum levels of inflammatory markers, such as SAA-LDL, CRP, and TNF-α. In contrast, sitagliptin increased serum IL-10, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, as well as plasma GLP-1. In addition, sitagliptin increased monocyte IL-10 expression and decreased monocyte TNF-α expression. Multivariate regression analysis revealed that the sitagliptin treatment was the only factor independently associated with an increase in monocyte IL-10 (β = 0.499; R2 = 0.293, P < 0.05). However, other factors including the improvement of glucose metabolism were not associated with the increase. Conclusions/interpretation This study is the first to show that a DPP-4 inhibitor, sitagliptin, reduces inflammatory cytokines and improves the unfavorable M1/M2-like phenotypes of peripheral blood monocytes in Japanese type 2 diabetic patients.},

   abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To study expression of the recently identified adipokine dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) in subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) of patients with various BMIs and insulin sensitivities, as well as to assess circulating DPP4 in relation to obesity and insulin sensitivity. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: DPP4 expression was measured in SAT and VAT from 196 subjects with a wide range of BMIs and insulin sensitivities. DPP4 release was measured ex vivo in paired biopsies from SAT and VAT as well as in vivo from SAT of lean and obese patients. Circulating DPP4 was measured in insulin-sensitive and insulin-resistant BMI-matched obese patients. RESULTS: DPP4 expression was positively correlated with BMI in both SAT and VAT, with VAT consistently displaying higher expression than SAT. Ex vivo release of DPP4 from adipose tissue explants was higher in VAT than in SAT in both lean and obese patients, with obese patients displaying higher DPP4 release than lean controls. Net release of DPP4 from adipose tissue was also demonstrated in vivo with greater release in obese subjects than in lean subjects and in women than in men. Insulin-sensitive obese patients had significantly lower circulating DPP4 than did obesity-matched insulin-resistant patients. In this experiment, DPP4 positively correlated with the amount of VAT, adipocyte size, and adipose tissue inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: DPP4, a novel adipokine, has a higher release from VAT that is particularly pronounced in obese and insulin-resistant patients. Our data suggest that DPP4 may be a marker for visceral obesity, insulin resistance, and the metabolic syndrome.},

   abstract = {Phelan-McDermid syndrome (PMDS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by global developmental delay, severely impaired speech, intellectual disability, and an increased risk of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). PMDS is caused by heterozygous deletions of chromosome 22q13.3. Among the genes in the deleted region is SHANK3, which encodes a protein in the postsynaptic density (PSD). Rare mutations in SHANK3 have been associated with idiopathic ASDs, non-syndromic intellectual disability, and schizophrenia. Although SHANK3 is considered to be the most likely candidate gene for the neurological abnormalities in PMDS patients, the cellular and molecular phenotypes associated with this syndrome in human neurons are unknown. We generated induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells from individuals with PMDS and autism and used them to produce functional neurons. We show that PMDS neurons have reduced SHANK3 expression and major defects in excitatory, but not inhibitory, synaptic transmission. Excitatory synaptic transmission in PMDS neurons can be corrected by restoring SHANK3 expression or by treating neurons with insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1). IGF1 treatment promotes formation of mature excitatory synapses that lack SHANK3 but contain PSD95 and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors with fast deactivation kinetics. Our findings provide direct evidence for a disruption in the ratio of cellular excitation and inhibition in PMDS neurons, and point to a molecular pathway that can be recruited to restore it.},

   abstract = {Glucagon-like-peptide-1 (GLP-1) and its long acting analogues comprise a novel class of type 2 diabetes (T2D) treatment. What makes them unique among other T2D drugs is their concurrent ability to reduce food intake, a great benefit considering the frequent comorbidity of T2D and obesity. The precise neural site of action underlying this beneficial effect is vigorously researched. In accordance with the classical model of food intake control GLP-1 action on feeding has been primarily ascribed to receptor populations in the hypothalamus and the hindbrain. In contrast to this common view, relevant GLP-1 receptor populations are distributed more widely, with a prominent mesolimbic complement emerging. The physiological relevance of the mesolimbic GLP-1 is suggested by the demonstration that similar anorexic effects can be obtained by independent stimulation of the mesolimbic and hypothalamic GLP-1 receptors. Results reviewed here support the idea that mesolimbic GLP-1 receptors are sufficient to reduce hunger-driven feeding, the hedonic value of food and food-motivation. In parallel, emerging evidence suggests that the range of action of GLP-1 on reward behavior is not limited to food-derived reward but extends to cocaine, amphetamine and alcohol reward. The new discoveries concerning GLP-1 action on the mesolimbic reward system significantly extend the potential therapeutic range of this drug target.},

   abstract = {A major focus of systems biology is to characterize interactions between cellular components, in order to develop an accurate picture of the intricate networks within biological systems. Over the past decade, protein microarrays have greatly contributed to advances in proteomics and are becoming an important platform for systems biology. Protein microarrays are highly flexible, ranging from large-scale proteome microarrays to smaller customizable microarrays, making the technology amenable for detection of a broad spectrum of biochemical properties of proteins. In this article, we will focus on the numerous studies that have utilized protein microarrays to reconstruct biological networks including protein–DNA interactions, posttranslational protein modifications (PTMs), lectin–glycan recognition, pathogen–host interactions and hierarchical signaling cascades. The diversity in applications allows for integration of interaction data from numerous molecular classes and cellular states, providing insight into the structure of complex biological systems. We will also discuss emerging applications and future directions of protein microarray technology in the global frontier.},

   abstract = {PTMs such as phosphorylation are often important actors in protein regulation and recognition. These functions require both visibility and accessibility to other proteins; that the modification is located at the surface of the protein. Currently, many repositories provide information on PTMs but structural information is often lacking. This study, which focuses on phosphorylation sites available in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot, illustrates that most phosphorylation sites are indeed found at the surface of the protein, but that some sites are found buried in the core of the protein. Several of these identified buried phosphorylation sites can easily become accessible upon small conformational changes while others would require the whole protein to unfold and are hence most unlikely modification sites. Subsequent analysis of phosphorylation sites available in PRIDE demonstrates that taking the structure of the protein into account would be a good guide in the identification of the actual phosphorylated positions in phophoproteomics experiments. This analysis illustrates that care must be taken when simply accepting the position of a PTM without first analyzing its position within the protein structure if the latter is available.},

   abstract = {The range of heterogeneous approaches available for quantifying protein abundance via mass spectrometry (MS)(1) leads to considerable challenges in modeling, archiving, exchanging, or submitting experimental data sets as supplemental material to journals. To date, there has been no widely accepted format for capturing the evidence trail of how quantitative analysis has been performed by software, for transferring data between software packages, or for submitting to public databases. In the context of the Proteomics Standards Initiative, we have developed the mzQuantML data standard. The standard can represent quantitative data about regions in two-dimensional retention time versus mass/charge space (called features), peptides, and proteins and protein groups (where there is ambiguity regarding peptide-to-protein inference), and it offers limited support for small molecule (metabolomic) data. The format has structures for representing replicate MS runs, grouping of replicates (for example, as study variables), and capturing the parameters used by software packages to arrive at these values. The format has the capability to reference other standards such as mzML and mzIdentML, and thus the evidence trail for the MS workflow as a whole can now be described. Several software implementations are available, and we encourage other bioinformatics groups to use mzQuantML as an input, internal, or output format for quantitative software and for structuring local repositories. All project resources are available in the public domain from the HUPO Proteomics Standards Initiative http://www.psidev.info/mzquantml.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidases (DP) 8 and 9 are homologous, cytoplasmic N-terminal post-proline-cleaving enzymes that are anti-targets for the development of DP4 (DPPIV/CD26) inhibitors for treating type II diabetes. To date, DP8 and DP9 have been implicated in immune responses and cancer biology, but their pathophysiological functions and substrate repertoire remain unknown. This study utilizes terminal amine isotopic labeling of substrates (TAILS), an N-terminal positional proteomic approach, for the discovery of in vivo DP8 and DP9 substrates. In vivo roles for DP8 and DP9 in cellular metabolism and homeostasis were revealed via the identification of more than 29 candidate natural substrates and pathways affected by DP8/DP9 overexpression. Cleavage of 14 substrates was investigated in vitro; 9/14 substrates for both DP8 and DP9 were confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS, including two of high confidence, calreticulin and adenylate kinase 2. Adenylate kinase 2 plays key roles in cellular energy and nucleotide homeostasis. These results demonstrate remarkable in vivo substrate overlap between DP8/DP9, suggesting compensatory roles for these enzymes. This work provides the first global investigation into DP8 and DP9 substrates, providing a number of leads for future investigations into the biological roles and significance of DP8 and DP9 in human health and disease.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as an important tool in the last decade and it is beginning to show potential to provide new information in many fields owing to its unique ability to acquire molecularly specific images and to provide multiplexed information, without the need for labeling or staining. In MSI, the chemical identity of molecules present on a surface is investigated as a function of spatial distribution. In addition to now standard methods involving MSI in vacuum, recently developed ambient ionization techniques allow MSI to be performed under atmospheric pressure on untreated samples outside the mass spectrometer. Here we review recent developments and applications of MSI emphasizing the ambient ionization techniques of desorption electrospray ionization (DESI), laser ablation electrospray ionization (LAESI), probe electrospray ionization (PESI), desorption atmospheric pressure photoionization (DAPPI), femtosecond laser desorption ionization (fs-LDI), laser electrospray mass spectrometry (LEMS), infrared laser ablation metastable-induced chemical ionization (IR-LAMICI), liquid microjunction surface sampling probe mass spectrometry (LMJ-SSP MS), nanospray desorption electrospray ionization (nano-DESI), and plasma sources such as the low temperature plasma (LTP) probe and laser ablation coupled to flowing atmospheric-pressure afterglow (LA-FAPA). Included are discussions of some of the features of ambient MSI for example the ability to implement chemical reactions with the goal of providing high abundance ions characteristic of specific compounds of interest and the use of tandem mass spectrometry to either map the distribution of targeted molecules with high specificity or to provide additional MS information on the structural identification of compounds. We also describe the role of bioinformatics in acquiring and interpreting the chemical and spatial information obtained through MSI, especially in biological applications for tissue diagnostic purposes. Finally, we discuss the challenges in ambient MSI and include perspectives on the future of the field.},

   abstract = {The introduction of dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) inhibitors for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes acknowledges the fundamental importance of incretin hormones in the regulation of glycemia. Small molecule inhibitors of DPP4 exert their effects via inhibition of enzymatic degradation of glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP). The widespread expression of DPP4 in tissues such as the vasculature and immune cells suggests that this protein may play a role in cardiovascular function. DPP4 is known to exert its effects via both enzymatic and non-enzymatic mechanisms. A soluble form of DPP4 lacking the cytoplasmic and transmembrane domain has also been recently recognized. Besides enzymatic inactivation of incretins, DPP4 also mediates degradation of many chemokines and neuropeptides. The non-enzymatic function of DPP4 plays a critical role in providing co-stimulatory signals to T cells via adenosine deaminase (ADA). DPP4 may also regulate inflammatory responses in innate immune cells such as monocytes and dendritic cells. The multiplicity of functions and targets suggests that DPP4 may play a distinct role aside from its effects on the incretin axis. Indeed recent studies in experimental models of atherosclerosis provide evidence for a robust effect for these drugs in attenuating inflammation and plaque development. Several prospective randomized controlled clinical trials in humans with established atherosclerosis are testing the effects of DPP4 inhibition on hard cardiovascular events.},

We quantified 11,520 proteins, making this the most comprehensive proteomic resource of any organ to date. Global protein copy number determination demonstrated that a large proportion of the hepatocyte proteome is dedicated to fatty acid and xenobiotic metabolism. We identified as-yet-unknown components of the TGF-beta signaling pathway and extracellular matrix in hepatic stellate cells, uncovering their regulative role in liver physiology. Moreover, our high-resolution proteomic data set enabled us to compare the distinct functional roles of hepatic cell types in cholesterol flux, cellular trafficking, and growth factor receptor signaling.

   abstract = {AIM: To determine the specificity and sensitivity of assays carried out using commercially available kits for glucagon and/or oxyntomodulin measurements. METHODS: Ten different assay kits used for the measurement of either glucagon or oxyntomodulin concentrations were obtained. Solutions of synthetic glucagon (proglucagon (PG) residues 3361), oxyntomodulin (PG residues 3369) and glicentin (PG residues 169) were prepared and peptide concentrations were verified by quantitative amino acid analysis and a processing-independent in-house RIA. Peptides were added to the matrix (assay buffer) supplied with the kits (concentration range: 1.25-300 pmol/l) and to human plasma and recoveries were determined. Assays yielding meaningful results were analysed for precision and sensitivity by repeated analysis and ability to discriminate low concentrations. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Three assays were specific for glucagon (carried out using the Millipore (Billerica, MA, USA), Bio-Rad (Sundbyberg, Sweden), and ALPCO (Salem, NH, USA) and Yanaihara Institute (Shizuoka, Japan) kits), but none was specific for oxyntomodulin. The assay carried out using the Phoenix (Burlingame, CA, USA) glucagon kit measured the concentrations of all three peptides (total glucagon) equally. Sensitivity and precision were generally poor; the assay carried out using the Millipore RIA kit performed best with a sensitivity around 10 pmol/l. Assays carried out using the BlueGene (Shanghai, China), USCN LIFE (Wuhan, China) (oxyntomodulin and glucagon), MyBioSource (San Diego, CA, USA) and Phoenix oxyntomodulin kits yielded inconsistent results.},

   abstract = {The rise of the "Top Down" method in the field of mass spectrometry-based proteomics has ushered in a new age of promise and challenge for the characterization and identification of proteins. Injecting intact proteins into the mass spectrometer allows for better characterization of post-translational modifications and avoids several of the serious "inference" problems associated with peptide-based proteomics. However, successful implementation of a Top Down approach to endogenous or other biologically relevant samples often requires the use of one or more forms of separation prior to mass spectrometric analysis, which have only begun to mature for whole protein MS. Recent advances in instrumentation have been used in conjunction with new ion fragmentation using photons and electrons that allow for better (and often complete) protein characterization on cases simply not tractable even just a few years ago. Finally, the use of native electrospray mass spectrometry has shown great promise for the identification and characterization of whole protein complexes in the 100 kDa to 1 MDa regime, with prospects for complete compositional analysis for endogenous protein assemblies a viable goal over the coming few years.},

   abstract = {To broaden our understanding of the evolution of gene regulation mechanisms, we generated occupancy profiles for 34 orthologous transcription factors (TFs) in human-mouse erythroid progenitor, lymphoblast and embryonic stem-cell lines. By combining the genome-wide transcription factor occupancy repertoires, associated epigenetic signals, and co-association patterns, here we deduce several evolutionary principles of gene regulatory features operating since the mouse and human lineages diverged. The genomic distribution profiles, primary binding motifs, chromatin states, and DNA methylation preferences are well conserved for TF-occupied sequences. However, the extent to which orthologous DNA segments are bound by orthologous TFs varies both among TFs and with genomic location: binding at promoters is more highly conserved than binding at distal elements. Notably, occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences tend to be pleiotropic; they function in several tissues and also co-associate with many TFs. Single nucleotide variants at sites with potential regulatory functions are enriched in occupancy-conserved TF-occupied sequences.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has evolved into a valuable tool across many fields of chemistry, biology, and medicine. However, arguably its greatest disadvantage is the difficulty in acquiring quantitative data regarding the surface concentration of the analyte(s) of interest. These difficulties largely arise from the high dependence of the ion signal on the localized chemical and morphological environment and the difficulties associated with calibrating such signals. The development of quantitative MSI approaches would correspond to a giant leap forward for the field, particularly for the biomedical and pharmaceutical fields, and is thus a highly active area of current research. In this review, we outline the current progress being made in the development and application of quantitative MSI workflows with a focus on biomedical applications. Particular emphasis is placed on the various strategies used for both signal calibration and correcting for various ion suppression effects that are invariably present in any MSI study. In addition, the difficulties in validating quantitative-MSI data on a pixel-by-pixel basis are highlighted.},

   abstract = {This letter analyzes two large-scale proteomics studies published in the same issue of Nature. At the time of the release, both studies were portrayed as draft maps of the human proteome and great advances in the field. As with the initial publication of the human genome, these papers have broad appeal and will no doubt lead to a great deal of further analysis by the scientific community. However, we were intrigued by the number of protein-coding genes detected by the two studies, numbers that far exceeded what has been reported for the multinational Human Proteome Project effort. We carried out a simple quality test on the data using the olfactory receptor family. A high-quality proteomics experiment that does not specifically analyze nasal tissues should not expect to detect many peptides for olfactory receptors. Neither of the studies carried out experiments on nasal tissues, yet we found peptide evidence for more than 100 olfactory receptors in the two studies. These results suggest that the two studies are substantially overestimating the number of protein coding genes they identify. We conclude that the experimental data from these two studies should be used with caution.},

In this article, we review three HUPO-PSI data standards - mzML, mzIdentML and mzQuantML, which can be used to design a complete quantitative analysis pipeline in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics. In this tutorial, we briefly describe the content of each data model, sufficient for bioinformaticians to devise proteomics software. We also provide guidance on the use of recently released application programming interfaces (APIs) developed in Java for each of these standards, which makes it straightforward to read and write files of any size. We have produced a set of example Java classes and a basic graphical user interface to demonstrate how to use the most important parts of the PSI standards, available from http://code.google.com/p/psi-standard-formats-tutorial.

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is best known for its heightened expression in tumour stroma. This atypical serine protease has both dipeptidyl peptidase and endopeptidase activities, cleaving substrates at a post-proline bond. FAP expression is difficult to detect in non-diseased adult organs, but is greatly upregulated in sites of tissue remodelling, which include liver fibrosis, lung fibrosis, atherosclerosis, arthritis, tumours and embryonic tissues. Due to its restricted expression pattern and dual enzymatic activities, FAP is emerging as a unique therapeutic target. However, methods to exploit and target this protease are advancing more rapidly than knowledge of the fundamental biology of FAP. This review highlights this imbalance, emphasising the need to better define the substrate repertoire and expression patterns of FAP to elucidate its role in biological and pathological processes.},

   abstract = {Mass spectrometry (MS)-based studies of synthetic polymers often characterise detected polymer components using mass data alone. However when mass-based characterisations are ambiguous, tandem MS (MS/MS) offers a means by which additional analytical information may be collected. This review provides a synopsis of two particularly promising methods of dissociating polymer ions during MS/MS: electron-capture and electron-transfer dissociation (ECD and ETD, respectively). The article opens with a summary of the basic characteristics and operating principles of ECD and ETD, and relates these techniques to other methods of dissociating gas-phase ions, such as collision-induced dissociation (CID). Insights into ECD- and ETD-based MS/MS, gained from studies into proteins and peptides, are then discussed in relation to polymer chemistry. Finally, ECD- and ETD-based studies into various classes of polymer are summarised; for each polymer class, ECD- and ETD-derived data are compared to CID-derived data. These discussions identify ECD and ETD as powerful means by which unique and diagnostically useful polymer ion fragmentation data may be generated, and techniques worthy of increased utilisation by the polymer chemistry community.},

   abstract = {We describe the comprehensive analysis of the yeast proteome in just over one hour of optimized analysis. We achieve this expedited proteome characterization with improved sample preparation, chromatographic separations, and by using a new Orbitrap hybrid mass spectrometer equipped with a mass filter, a collision cell, a high-field Orbitrap analyzer, and, finally, a dual cell linear ion trap analyzer (Q-OT-qIT, Orbitrap Fusion). This system offers high MS(2) acquisition speed of 20 Hz and detects up to 19 peptide sequences within a single second of operation. Over a 1.3 h chromatographic method, the Q-OT-qIT hybrid collected an average of 13,447 MS(1) and 80,460 MS(2) scans (per run) to produce 43,400 (x) peptide spectral matches and 34,255 (x) peptides with unique amino acid sequences (1% false discovery rate (FDR)). On average, each one hour analysis achieved detection of 3,977 proteins (1% FDR). We conclude that further improvements in mass spectrometer scan rate could render comprehensive analysis of the human proteome within a few hours.},

Axiomatically, since optimal body composition enhances reproductive function, general somatic actions of GH modulate reproductive function. A growing body of evidence supports the hypothesis that GH also modulates reproduction directly, exerting both gonadotropin-dependent and gonadotropin-independent actions in both males and females. Moreover, recent studies indicate GH produced within reproductive tissues differs from pituitary GH in terms of secretion and action. Accordingly, GH is increasingly used as a fertility adjunct in males and females, both humans and nonhumans. This review reconsiders reproductive actions of GH in vertebrates in respect to these new conceptual developments.},

   abstract = {Gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) acts as an important regulatory peptide in several normal physiological processes and as a growth factor in certain cancers. In this review we provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of knowledge of GRP in urological tissues under both normal and cancerous conditions. GRP and its receptor, GRP-R, are expressed in the normal kidney and renal cancers. GRP can stimulate the growth of renal cancer cells. GRP and GRP-R are expressed in prostate cancer and GRP can stimulate the growth of prostate cancer cell lines. Importantly, GRP is a key neuroendocrine peptide, which may be involved in the progression of advanced prostate cancer and in the neuroendocrine differentiation of prostate cancer. Recent animal studies have shown that GRP and GRP-R are an integral part of male sexual function and play a crucial role in spinal control of erections and ejaculation.},

   abstract = {The granzyme family serine proteases are key effector molecules expressed by cytotoxic lymphocytes. The physiological role of granzyme (Gzm) A is controversial, with significant debate over its ability to induce death in target cells. Here, we investigate the natural inhibitors of GzmA. We employed substrate phage display and positional proteomics to compare substrate specificities of mouse (m) and human (h) GzmA at the peptide and proteome-wide levels and we used the resulting substrate specificity profiles to search for potential inhibitors from the intracellular serpin family. We identified Serpinb6b as a potent inhibitor of mGzmA. Serpinb6b interacts with mGzmA, but not hGzmA, with an association constant of 1.9 ± 0.8 × 10 5 M-1 s-1 and a stoichiometry of inhibition of 1.8. Mouse GzmA is over five times more cytotoxic than hGzmA when delivered into P815 target cells with streptolysin O, whereas transfection of target cells with a Serpinb6b cDNA increases the EC50 value of mGzmA 13-fold, without affecting hGzmA cytotoxicity. Unexpectedly, we also found that Serpinb6b employs an exosite to specifically inhibit dimeric but not monomeric mGzmA. The identification of an intracellular inhibitor specific for mGzmA only indicates that a lineage-specific increase in GzmA cytotoxic potential has driven cognate inhibitor evolution. © 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

   abstract = {In the hierarchy of data, information and knowledge, computational methods play a major role in the initial processing of data to extract information, but they alone become less effective to compile knowledge from information. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) resource (http://www.kegg.jp/ or http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) has been developed as a reference knowledge base to assist this latter process. In particular, the KEGG pathway maps are widely used for biological interpretation of genome sequences and other high-throughput data. The link from genomes to pathways is made through the KEGG Orthology system, a collection of manually defined ortholog groups identified by K numbers. To better automate this interpretation process the KEGG modules defined by Boolean expressions of K numbers have been expanded and improved. Once genes in a genome are annotated with K numbers, the KEGG modules can be computationally evaluated revealing metabolic capacities and other phenotypic features. The reaction modules, which represent chemical units of reactions, have been used to analyze design principles of metabolic networks and also to improve the definition of K numbers and associated annotations. For translational bioinformatics, the KEGG MEDICUS resource has been developed by integrating drug labels (package inserts) used in society.},

However, an equivalent map for the human proteome with direct measurements of proteins and peptides does not exist yet. Here we present a draft map of the human proteome using high-resolution Fourier-transform mass spectrometry. In-depth proteomic profiling of 30 histologically normal human samples, including 17 adult tissues, 7 fetal tissues and 6 purified primary haematopoietic cells, resulted in identification of proteins encoded by 17,294 genes accounting for approximately 84% of the total annotated protein-coding genes in humans. A unique and comprehensive strategy for proteogenomic analysis enabled us to discover a number of novel protein-coding regions, which includes translated pseudogenes, non-coding RNAs and upstream open reading frames. This large human proteome catalogue (available as an interactive web-based resource at http://www.humanproteomemap.org) will complement available human genome and transcriptome data to accelerate biomedical research in health and disease.},

Heart failure is a heterogeneous and complex syndrome, arising from various etiologies, which result in cellular phenotypes that vary from patient to patient. The ability to utilize genetic manipulation and biochemical experimentation in animal models has made them indispensable in the study of this chronic condition. Similarly, proteomics has been helpful for elucidating complicated cellular and molecular phenotypes and has the potential to identify circulating biomarkers and drug targets for therapeutic intervention. In this review, the use of human samples and animal model systems (pig, dog, rat, mouse, zebrafish, and fruit fly) in cardiac research is discussed. Additionally, the protein sequence homology between these species and the extent of conservation at the level of the phospho-proteome in major kinase signaling cascades involved in heart failure are investigated. © The Authors - PROTEOMICS Clinical Applications Published by Wiley-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

This robust and scalable method largely eliminates contamination or loss. Peptides can be eluted in several fractions or in one step for single-run proteome analysis. In one day, we obtained the largest proteome coverage to date for budding and fission yeast, and found that protein copy numbers in these cells were highly correlated (R(2) = 0.78). Applying the in-StageTip method to quadruplicate measurements of a human cell line, we obtained copy-number estimates for 9,667 human proteins and observed excellent quantitative reproducibility between replicates (R(2) = 0.97). The in-StageTip method is straightforward and generally applicable in biological or clinical applications.},

   abstract = {Owing to its labile nature, a new role for cysteine sulfenic acid (-SOH) modification has emerged. This oxidative modification modulates protein function by acting as a redox switch during cellular signaling. The identification of proteins that undergo this modification represents a methodological challenge, and its resolution remains a matter of current interest. The development of strategies to chemically modify cysteinyl-containing peptides for LC-MS/MS analysis has increased significantly within the past decade. The method of choice to selectively label sulfenic acid is based on the use of dimedone or its derivatives. For these chemical probes to be effective on a proteome-wide level, their reactivity toward -SOH must be high to ensure reaction completion. In addition, the presence of an adduct should not interfere with electrospray ionization, the efficiency of induced dissociation in MS/MS experiments, or with identification of Cys-modified peptides by automated database searching algorithms. Herein, we employ a targeted proteomics approach to study the electrospray ionization and fragmentation effects of different –SOH specific probes, and compared them to commonly used alkylating agents. We then extend our study to a whole proteome extract using shotgun proteomic approaches. These experiments enable us to demonstrate that dimedone adducts do not interfere with electrospray by suppressing the ionization nor impedes product ion assignment by automated search engines, which detect a + 138 Da increase from unmodified peptides. Collectively, these results suggest dimedone can be a powerful tool to identify sulfenic acid modifications by high-throughput shotgun proteomics of a whole proteome.},

   abstract = {Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation imaging mass spectrometry (MALDI-MSI) is a rapidly advancing technique for intact tissue analysis that allows simultaneous localisation and quantification of biomolecules in different histological regions of interest. This approach can potentially offer novel insights into tumour microenvironmental (TME) biochemistry. In this study we employed MALDI-MSI to evaluate fresh frozen sections of colorectal cancer (CRC) tissue and adjacent healthy mucosa obtained from 12 consenting patients undergoing surgery for confirmed CRC. Specifically, we sought to address three objectives: (1) To identify biochemical differences between different morphological regions within the CRC TME; (2) To characterise the biochemical differences between cancerous and healthy colorectal tissue using MALDI-MSI; (3) To determine whether MALDI-MSI profiling of tumour-adjacent tissue can identify novel metabolic 'field effects' associated with cancer. Our results demonstrate that CRC tissue harbours characteristic phospholipid signatures compared with healthy tissue and additionally, different tissue regions within the CRC TME reveal distinct biochemical profiles. Furthermore we observed biochemical differences between tumour-adjacent and tumour-remote healthy mucosa. We have referred to this 'field effect', exhibited by the tumour locale, as cancer-adjacent metaboplasia (CAM) and this finding builds on the established concept of field cancerisation.},

   abstract = {Human catestatin CgA352-372 (SL21) is an endogenous neuropeptide with multiple biological functions. The present study aimed to evaluate the antioxidant, antibacterial, cytotoxic, and DNA damage protective effects of SL21 neuropeptide. SL21 neuropeptide generated from the C-terminus of chromogranin A (CgA) was synthesized by solid-phase method. Synthetic peptide was subjected to various in vitro antioxidant assays including the scavenging of 1,1-diphenyl-2-pycryl-hydrazyl (DPPH), 2,2-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid) (ABTS(.+) ), and hydroxyl free radicals, metal ion chelation, inhibition of lipid peroxidation, and reducing power. Moreover, protective effect of SL21 on H2 O2 -induced DNA damage was analyzed using pTZ57/RT plasmid. Methylthiazoltetrazolium assay was also performed to study the cytotoxic effect of SL21 neuropeptide on human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, antibacterial and hemolysis assays were conducted. The results demonstrated high activities of SL21 in scavenging free radicals (DPPH, ABTS(.+) , and hydroxyl), chelating of Cu(2+) /Fe(2+) metal ions, reducing power, and inhibition of lipid peroxidation in a concentration-dependent manner. SL21 neuropeptide revealed a protective effect on DNA damage caused by hydroxyl radicals. Interestingly, the peptide exhibited no significant cytotoxicity towards peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Furthermore, SL21 peptide displayed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa without any hemolytic activity on human red blood cells. Conclusively, the present study established SL21 (catestatin) as a novel antioxidative peptide that could further be investigated for its potential use as a pharmaceutical agent.},

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) is a widely expressed enzyme transducing actions through an anchored transmembrane molecule and a soluble circulating protein. Both membrane-associated and soluble DPP4 exert catalytic activity, cleaving proteins containing a position 2 alanine or proline. DPP4-mediated enzymatic cleavage alternatively inactivates peptides or generates new bioactive moieties that may exert competing or novel activities. The widespread use of selective DPP4 inhibitors for the treatment of type 2 diabetes has heightened interest in the molecular mechanisms through which DPP4 inhibitors exert their pleiotropic actions. Here we review the biology of DPP4 with a focus on: 1) identification of pharmacological vs physiological DPP4 substrates; and 2) elucidation of mechanisms of actions of DPP4 in studies employing genetic elimination or chemical reduction of DPP4 activity. We review data identifying the roles of key DPP4 substrates in transducing the glucoregulatory, anti-inflammatory, and cardiometabolic actions of DPP4 inhibitors in both preclinical and clinical studies. Finally, we highlight experimental pitfalls and technical challenges encountered in studies designed to understand the mechanisms of action and downstream targets activated by inhibition of DPP4.},

   abstract = {Fibroblast activation protein (FAP) is a focus of interest as a potential cancer therapy target. This membrane bound protease possesses the unique catalytic activity of hydrolysis of the post-proline bond two or more residues from the N-terminus of substrates. FAP is highly expressed in activated fibroblastic cells in tumours, arthritis and fibrosis. A rare, novel, human polymorphism, C1088T, encoding Ser363 to Leu, occurring in the sixth blade of the beta propeller domain, was identified in a family. Both in primary human fibroblasts and in Ser363LeuFAP transfected cells, we showed that this single substitution ablates FAP dimerisation and causes loss of enzyme activity. Ser363LeuFAP was detectable only in endoplasmic reticulum (ER), in contrast to the distribution of wild-type FAP on the cell surface. The variant FAP showed decreased conformational antibody binding, consistent with an altered tertiary structure. Ser363LeuFAP expression was associated with upregulation of the ER chaperone BiP/GRP78, ER stress sensor ATF6, and the ER stress response target phospho-eIF2alpha, all indicators of ER stress. Proteasomal inhibition resulted in accumulation of Ser363LeuFAP, indicating the involvement of ER associated degradation (ERAD). Neither CHOP expression nor apoptosis was elevated, so ERAD is probably important for protecting Ser363LeuFAP expressing cells. These data on the first loss of function human FAP gene variant indicates that although the protein is vulnerable to an amino acid substitution in the beta-propeller domain, inactive, unfolded FAP can be tolerated by cells.},

OXM reduces food intake and increases energy expenditure in humans. While activation of the GCGR increases glucose production posing a hyperglycemic risk, the simultaneous activation of the GLP1R counteracts this effect. Acute OXM infusion improves glucose tolerance in T2DM patients making dual agonists of the GCGR and GLP1R new promising treatments for diabetes and obesity with the potential for weight loss and glucose lowering superior to that of GLP1R agonists.},

   abstract = {Background Parkinson's Disease (PD) is one of the most prevailing neurodegenerative diseases. Improving diagnoses and treatments of this disease is essential, as currently there exists no cure for this disease. Microarray and proteomics data have revealed abnormal expression of several genes and proteins responsible for PD. Nevertheless, few studies have been reported involving PD-specific protein-protein interactions. Results Microarray based gene expression data and protein-protein interaction (PPI) databases were combined to construct the PPI networks of differentially expressed (DE) genes in post mortem brain tissue samples of patients with Parkinson's disease. Samples were collected from the substantia nigra and the frontal cerebral cortex. From the microarray data, two sets of DE genes were selected by 2-tailed t-tests and Significance Analysis of Microarrays (SAM), run separately to construct two Query-Query PPI (QQPPI) networks. Several topological properties of these networks were studied. Nodes with High Connectivity (hubs) and High Betweenness Low Connectivity (bottlenecks) were identified to be the most significant nodes of the networks. Three and four-cliques were identified in the QQPPI networks. These cliques contain most of the topologically significant nodes of the networks which form core functional modules consisting of tightly knitted sub-networks. Hitherto unreported 37 PD disease markers were identified based on their topological significance in the networks. Of these 37 markers, eight were significantly involved in the core functional modules and showed significant change in co-expression levels. Four (ARRB2, STX1A, TFRC and MARCKS) out of the 37 markers were found to be associated with several neurotransmitters including dopamine. Conclusion This study represents a novel investigation of the PPI networks for PD, a complex disease. 37 proteins identified in our study can be considered as PD network biomarkers. These network biomarkers may provide as potential therapeutic targets for PD applications development.},

   abstract = {SIGNIFICANCE: The detrimental effects of ionizing radiation (IR) involve a highly orchestrated series of events that are amplified by endogenous signaling and culminating in oxidative damage to DNA, lipids, proteins, and many metabolites. Despite the global impact of IR, the molecular mechanisms underlying tissue damage reveal that many biomolecules are chemoselectively modified by IR. RECENT ADVANCES: The development of high-throughput "omics" technologies for mapping DNA and protein modifications have revolutionized the study of IR effects on biological systems. Studies in cells, tissues, and biological fluids are used to identify molecular features or biomarkers of IR exposure and response and the molecular mechanisms that regulate their expression or synthesis. CRITICAL ISSUES: In this review, chemical mechanisms are described for IR-induced modifications of biomolecules along with methods for their detection. Included with the detection methods are crucial experimental considerations and caveats for their use. Additional factors critical to the cellular response to radiation, including alterations in protein expression, metabolomics, and epigenetic factors, are also discussed. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: Throughout the review, the synergy of combined "omics" technologies such as genomics and epigenomics, proteomics, and metabolomics is highlighted. These are anticipated to lead to new hypotheses to understand IR effects on biological systems and improve IR-based therapies.},

   abstract = {The quadrupole Orbitrap mass spectrometer (Q Exactive) has made a powerful proteomics instrument available in a benchtop format. It significantly boosted analyzable proteins per hour and has now evolved into a proteomics analysis workhorse for many laboratories. Here we describe the Q Exactive Plus and Q Exactive HF mass spectrometers, which feature several innovations in comparison to the original Q Exactive instrument. A low resolution pre-filter has been implemented within the injection flatapole, preventing unwanted ions from entering deep into the system, and thereby increasing its robustness. A new segmented quadrupole, with higher fidelity of isolation efficiency over a wide range of isolation windows, provides an almost two-fold improvement of transmission at narrow isolation widths. Additionally, the Q Exactive HF has a compact Orbitrap analyzer, leading to higher field strength and almost doubling resolution at the same transient times. With its very fast isolation and fragmentation capabilities, the instrument achieves overall cycle times of 1 s for a top 15 to 20 HCD (Higher energy Collisional Dissociation) method. We demonstrate identification of 5,000 proteins in standard 90-min gradients of tryptic digests of mammalian cell lysate, an increase of over 40% for detected peptides and over 20% for detected proteins. Additionally, we tested the instrument on peptide phosphorylation enriched samples, for which an improvement of up to 60% class I sites was observed.},

Molecule-specific imaging can be achieved using various ionization techniques that are suited to different applications but which all yield data with high mass accuracies and spatial resolutions. The ability to simultaneously obtain images showing the distributions of chemical species ranging from metal ions to macromolecules makes it possible to explore the chemical organization of a sample and to correlate the results obtained with specific anatomical features. The imaging of biomolecules has provided new insights into multiple neurological diseases, including Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease. Mass spectrometry imaging can also be used in conjunction with other imaging techniques in order to identify correlations between changes in the distribution of important chemical species and other changes in the properties of the tissue. Here we review the applications of mass spectrometry imaging in neuroscience research and discuss its potential. The results presented demonstrate that mass spectrometry imaging is a useful experimental method with diverse applications in neuroscience.},

   abstract = {The basic body plan and major physiological axes have been highly conserved during mammalian evolution, yet only a small fraction of the human genome sequence appears to be subject to evolutionary constraint. To quantify cis- versus trans-acting contributions to mammalian regulatory evolution, we performed genomic DNase I footprinting of the mouse genome across 25 cell and tissue types, collectively defining [sim]8.6 million transcription factor (TF) occupancy sites at nucleotide resolution. Here we show that mouse TF footprints conjointly encode a regulatory lexicon that is [sim]95% similar with that derived from human TF footprints. However, only [sim]20% of mouse TF footprints have human orthologues. Despite substantial turnover of the cis-regulatory landscape, nearly half of all pairwise regulatory interactions connecting mouse TF genes have been maintained in orthologous human cell types through evolutionary innovation of TF recognition sequences. Furthermore, the higher-level organization of mouse TF-to-TF connections into cellular network architectures is nearly identical with human. Our results indicate that evolutionary selection on mammalian gene regulation is targeted chiefly at the level of trans-regulatory circuitry, enabling and potentiating cis-regulatory plasticity.},

   abstract = {RATIONALE: The signal intensity of a given molecule across a tissue section when measured using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is prone to changes caused by the molecular heterogeneity across the surface of the tissue. Here we propose a strategy to investigate these effects using electrospray ionization (ESI) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) on a single high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) platform. METHODS: A rat was administered with a single inhaled dose of a compound and sacrificed 1 h after dosing. Sections were prepared from the excised frozen lung and analysed using MALDI, liquid extraction surface analysis (LESA) nano-ESI-MS and nano-ESI liquid chromatography (LC)/MS. The ESI and MALDI ion sources were mounted either side of the ion transfer system of the same Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometer. RESULTS: MALDI MSI clearly demonstrated widespread distribution of the dosed molecule throughout the lung, with the exception of a non-lung section of tissue on the same sample surface. Comparison of the lipid signals across the sample indicated a change in signal between the lung and the adipose tissue present on the same section. Use of ESI and MALDI, with and without an internal standard, supported the evaluation of changes in the signal of the dosed molecule across the tissue section. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the successful application of a dual ion source HRMS system to the systematic evaluation of data from MALDI MSI, used to determine the distribution of an inhaled drug in the lung. The system discussed is of great utility in investigating the effects of ion suppression and evaluating the quantitative and qualitative nature of the MSI data.

   abstract = {Dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4) is known to inactivate incretins as well as important chemokines and neuropeptides. DPP4 is expressed as a transmembrane protein but also occurs as a soluble enzyme circulating in the blood. However, the origin of the soluble DPP4 (sDPP4) is still unknown. In this study, DPP4 activity was quantified in plasma and extracted from different rat organs. Then, in order to see if the kidney or the bone marrow was the source of sDPP4, kidney or bone marrow transplantation was performed between wildtype (wt) Dark Agouti (DA) and DPP4 deficient congenic rats (n=6-9). Kidney was verified to have the highest DPP4 activity, followed by spleen and lung. In the following three weeks after successful kidney transplantation only transient trace plasma DPP4 activity was detected in DPP4 deficient rats receiving wt kidneys. In addition, DPP4 activity was not diminished in DA wt rats receiving DPP4 deficient kidneys. Both findings indicated that sDPP4 did not originate from the kidney. In contrast, 43+/-14% (compared to wt) sDPP4 activity was detected in the plasma of DPP4 deficient DA rats that were reconstituted with wt bone marrow cells. Not only leukocyte but also macrophage subpopulations express DPP4 in bone marrow as well as in blood as assessed by flow cytometry. Thus, bone marrow derived cells but not the kidney represent at least one source of sDPP4. And leukocyte or macrophage subpopulations could be potential candidates.},

Here we present a mass-spectrometry-based draft of the human proteome and a public, high-performance, in-memory database for real-time analysis of terabytes of big data, called ProteomicsDB. The information assembled from human tissues, cell lines and body fluids enabled estimation of the size of the protein-coding genome, and identified organ-specific proteins and a large number of translated lincRNAs (long intergenic non-coding RNAs). Analysis of messenger RNA and protein-expression profiles of human tissues revealed conserved control of protein abundance, and integration of drug-sensitivity data enabled the identification of proteins predicting resistance or sensitivity. The proteome profiles also hold considerable promise for analysing the composition and stoichiometry of protein complexes. ProteomicsDB thus enables navigation of proteomes, provides biological insight and fosters the development of proteomic technology.},

By comparing with the human genome, we not only confirm substantial conservation in the newly annotated potential functional sequences, but also find a large degree of divergence of sequences involved in transcriptional regulation, chromatin state and higher order chromatin organization.

   abstract = {MALDI Imaging mass spectrometry has entered the field of tissue-based research by providing unique advantages for analyzing tissue specimen in an unprecedented detail. A broad spectrum of analytes ranging from proteins, peptides, protein modification over small molecules, drugs and their metabolites as well as pharmaceutical components, endogenous cell metabolites, lipids, and other analytes are made accessible by this in situ technique in tissue. Some of them were even not accessible in tissues within the histological context before. Thereby, the great advantage of MALDI Imaging is the correlation of molecular information with traditional histology by keeping the spatial localization information of the analytes after mass spectrometric measurement. This method is label-free and allows multiplex analysis of hundreds to thousands of molecules in the very same tissue section simultaneously. Imaging mass spectrometry brings a new quality of molecular data and links the expert discipline of pathology and deep molecular mass spectrometric analysis to tissue-based research. This review will focus on state-of-the-art of MALDI Imaging mass spectrometry, its recent applications by analyzing tissue specimen and the contributions in understanding the biology of disease as well as its perspectives for pathology research and practice.},

   abstract = {Purpose of review Research into the fundamental mechanisms of erythropoiesis has provided critical insights into inherited and acquired disorders of the erythrocyte. Studies of human erythropoiesis have primarily utilized in-vitro systems, whereas murine models have provided insights from in-vivo studies. This report reviews recent insights into human and murine erythropoiesis gained from transcriptome-based analyses. Recent findings The availability of high-throughput genomic methodologies has allowed attainment of detailed gene expression data from cells at varying developmental and differentiation stages of erythropoiesis. Transcriptome analyses of human and murine reveal both stage and species-specific similarities and differences across terminal erythroid differentiation. Erythroid-specific long noncoding RNAs exhibit poor sequence conservation between human and mouse. Genome-wide analyses of alternative splicing reveal that complex, dynamic, stage-specific programs of alternative splicing program are utilized during terminal erythroid differentiation. Transcriptome data provide a significant resource for understanding mechanisms of normal and perturbed erythropoiesis. Understanding these processes will provide innovative strategies to detect, diagnose, prevent, and treat hematologic disease. Summary Understanding the shared and different mechanisms controlling human and murine erythropoiesis will allow investigators to leverage the best model system to provide insights in normal and perturbed erythropoiesis.

Here we show that in vivo post-translational processing of chemokines by dipeptidylpeptidase 4 (DPP4, also known as CD26) limits lymphocyte migration to sites of inflammation and tumors. Inhibition of DPP4 enzymatic activity enhanced tumor rejection by preserving biologically active CXCL10 and increasing trafficking into the tumor by lymphocytes expressing the counter-receptor CXCR3. Furthermore, DPP4 inhibition improved adjuvant-based immunotherapy, adoptive T cell transfer and checkpoint blockade. These findings provide direct in vivo evidence for control of lymphocyte trafficking via CXCL10 cleavage and support the use of DPP4 inhibitors for stabilizing biologically active forms of chemokines as a strategy to enhance tumor immunotherapy.},

   abstract = {Hybrid quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass spectrometry is one of the two major principles used in proteomics. Although based on simple fundamentals, it has over the last decades greatly evolved in terms of achievable resolution, mass accuracy, and dynamic range. The Bruker impact platform of QTOF instruments takes advantage of these developments and here we develop and evaluate the impact II for shotgun proteomics applications. Adaption of our heated liquid chromatography system achieved very narrow peptide elution peaks. The impact II is equipped with a new collision cell with both axial and radial ion ejection, more than doubling ion extraction at high tandem MS frequencies. The new reflectron and detector improve resolving power compared with the previous model up to 80%, i.e. to 40,000 at m/z 1222. We analyzed the ion current from the inlet capillary and found very high transmission (>80%) up to the collision cell. Simulation and measurement indicated 60% transfer into the flight tube. We adapted MaxQuant for QTOF data, improving absolute average mass deviations to better than 1.45 ppm. More than 4800 proteins can be identified in a single run of HeLa digest in a 90 min gradient. The workflow achieved high technical reproducibility (R2 > 0.99) and accurate fold change determination in spike-in experiments in complex mixtures. Using label-free quantification we rapidly quantified haploid against diploid yeast and characterized overall proteome differences in mouse cell lines originating from different tissues. Finally, after high pH reversed-phase fractionation we identified 9515 proteins in a triplicate measurement of HeLa peptide mixture and 11,257 proteins in single measurements of cerebellum-the highest proteome coverage reported with a QTOF instrument so far.},

   abstract = {Fewer than half of all tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra acquired in shotgun proteomics experiments are typically matched to a peptide with high confidence. Here we determine the identity of unassigned peptides using an ultra-tolerant Sequest database search that allows peptide matching even with modifications of unknown masses up to ± 500 Da. In a proteome-wide data set on HEK293 cells (9,513 proteins and 396,736 peptides), this approach matched an additional 184,000 modified peptides, which were linked to biological and chemical modifications representing 523 distinct mass bins, including phosphorylation, glycosylation and methylation. We localized all unknown modification masses to specific regions within a peptide. Known modifications were assigned to the correct amino acids with frequencies >90%. We conclude that at least one-third of unassigned spectra arise from peptides with substoichiometric modifications. © 2015 Nature America, Inc. All rights reserved.},

A total BCMs content was revealed in the range 0–11.74 mg kg−1. The amount of BCM7 varied from 0 to 7.63 mg kg−1. Gorgonzola cheese presented the highest BCM7 quantity, and it was the only sample to contain all the searched BCMs. Cheddar, Gorgonzola, Maasdam and Grana Padano were assessed for BCMs content following a recently proposed standardized in vitro static gastrointestinal digestion method (Minekus et al., 2014). After the gastric step, BCM7 was found only in Cheddar and Gorgonzola (0.25 mg kg−1 and 2.87 mg kg−1, respectively), along with BCM4. Only the latter peptide was detected in Grana Padano, whereas none of the studied BCMs were identified in the digested Maasdam. At the end of intestinal phase, all samples contained BCM7 (0.12–1.26 mg kg−1); the BCM4 was released only in digested Gorgonzola. Based on these results, in vitro digestion of a serving size of the studied cheeses does not potentially release a BCM7 amount compatible with an in vivo opioid activity.},

On the 60th anniversary since its discovery, reversible protein phosphorylation is widely appreciated as an essential PTM regulating metabolism.

   abstract = {Leukocyte cell-derived chemotaxin 2 (LECT2) is a recently discovered hepatokine that mediates obesity-related metabolic disturbances. Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are novel therapeutic agents for inflammatory disorders including nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD). However, no research has examined the connections or functions of LECT2 and the novel DPP-4 inhibitor, gemigliptin, in NAFLD pathogenesis. High-fat diet (HFD)-fed C57BL/6 mice were used to investigate the effect of gemigliptin on hepatic steatosis and LECT2 expression. In the HepG2 cell line, LECT2 and gemigliptin signaling were analyzed by Western blot. LECT2 increased mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) phosphorylation, sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP)-1 cleavage, lipid accumulation, and insulin resistance in HepG2 cells; these events were significantly decreased by treatment with a c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) inhibitor. Gemigliptin increased AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) phosphorylation and inhibited tumor necrosis factor (TNF) alpha-induced mTOR phosphorylation, SREBP-1 cleavage, lipid accumulation, and LECT2 expression in HepG2 cells; these events were attenuated by an AMPK inhibitor. Gemigliptin recovered TNFalpha-induced inhibition of insulin receptor substrate (IRS)-1 and Akt phosphorylation that was abolished in LECT2 knockdown cells or by AMPK inhibition. In preliminary in vivo experiments, gemigliptin induced AMPK phosphorylation and inhibited LECT2 expression in liver tissues from HFD-fed mice. Mice fed with HFD and gemigliptin showed improved hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance compared to HFD-fed mice. Gemigliptin might alleviate hepatic steatosis and insulin resistance by inhibiting LECT2 expression by AMPK-dependent and JNK-dependent mechanisms, suggesting a direct protective effect against NAFLD progression.},

   abstract = {Decidualization is a crucial process for successful embryo implantation and pregnancy in humans. Defects in decidualization during early pregnancy are associated with several pregnancy complications, such as pre-eclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and recurrent pregnancy loss. However, the mechanism underlying decidualization remains poorly understood. In the present study, we performed a systematic analysis of decidualization- related genes using text mining. We identified 286 genes for humans and 287 genes for mice respectively, with an overlap of 111 genes shared by both species. Through enrichment test, we demonstrated that although divergence was observed, the majority of enriched gene ontology terms and pathways were shared by both species, suggesting that functional categories were more conserved than individual genes.We further constructed a decidualization-related protein-protein interaction network consisted of 344 nodes connected via 1,541 edges. We prioritized genes in this network and identified 12 genes that may be key regulators of decidualization. These findings would provide some clues for further research on the mechanism underlying decidualization. Copyright: © 2015 Liu, Wang.},

   abstract = {Background: A deeper understanding of differences and similarities in transcriptional regulation between species can uncover important information about gene functions and the role of genes in disease. Deciphering such patterns between mice and humans is especially important since mice play an essential role in biomedical research. Results: Here, in order to characterize evolutionary changes between humans and mice, we compared gene co-expression maps to evaluate the conservation of co-expression. We show that the conservation of co-expression connectivity of homologous genes is negatively correlated with molecular evolution rates, as expected. Then we investigated evolutionary aspects of gene sets related to functions, tissues, pathways and diseases. Genes expressed in the testis, eye and skin, and those associated with regulation of transcription, olfaction, PI3K signalling, response to virus and bacteria were more divergent between mice and humans in terms of co-expression connectivity. Surprisingly, a deeper investigation of the PI3K signalling cascade revealed that its divergence is caused by the most crucial genes of this pathway, such as mTOR and AKT2. On the other hand, our analysis revealed that genes expressed in the brain and in the bone, and those associated with cell adhesion, cell cycle, DNA replication and DNA repair are most strongly conserved in terms of co-expression network connectivity as well as having a lower rate of duplication events. Genes involved in lipid metabolism and genes specific to blood showed a signature of increased co-expression connectivity in the mouse. In terms of diseases, co-expression connectivity of genes related to metabolic disorders is the most strongly conserved between mice and humans and tumor-related genes the most divergent. Conclusions: This work contributes to discerning evolutionary patterns between mice and humans in terms of gene interactions. Conservation of co-expression is a powerful approach to identify gene targets and processes with potential similarity and divergence between mice and humans, which has implications for drug testing and other studies employing the mouse as a model organism. © 2015 Monaco et al.},

One of these peptides is beta-casomorphin (BCM) which belongs to a group of opioid peptides formed from beta-casein variants. Beta-casomorphin 7 (BCM7) has been demonstrated to be enzymatically released from the A1 or B beta-casein variant. Epidemiological evidence suggests the peptide BCM 7 is a risk factor for development of human diseases, including increased risk of type 1 diabetes and cardiovascular diseases but this has not been thoroughly substantiated by research studies. High performance liquid chromatography coupled to UV-Vis and mass spectrometry detection as well as enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been used to analyze BCMs in dairy products. BCMs have been detected in raw cow's milk and human milk and a variety of commercial cheeses, but their presence has yet to be confirmed in commercial yoghurts. The finding that BCMs are present in cheese suggests they could also form in yoghurt, but be degraded during yoghurt processing. Whether BCMs do form in yoghurt and the amount of BCM forming or degrading at different processing steps needs further investigation and possibly will depend on the heat treatment and fermentation process used, but it remains an intriguing unknown.},

   abstract = {Remarkable progress continues on the annotation of the proteins identified in the Human Proteome and on finding credible proteomic evidence for the expression of "missing proteins". Missing proteins are those with no previous protein-level evidence or insufficient evidence to make a confident identification upon reanalysis in PeptideAtlas and curation in neXtProt. Enhanced with several major new data sets published in 2014, the human proteome presented as neXtProt, version 2014-09-19, has 16,491 unique confident proteins (PE level 1), up from 13,664 at 2012-12 and 15,646 at 2013-09. That leaves 2948 missing proteins from genes classified having protein existence level PE 2, 3, or 4, as well as 616 dubious proteins at PE 5. Here, we document the progress of the HPP and discuss the importance of assessing the quality of evidence, confirming automated findings and considering alternative protein matches for spectra and peptides. We provide guidelines for proteomics investigators to apply in reporting newly identified proteins.},

   abstract = {With the development of soft ionization techniques such as electrospray ionization (ESI), mass spectrometry (MS) has found widespread application in structural biology. The ability to transfer large biomolecular complexes intact into the gas-phase, combined with the low sample consumption and high sensitivity of MS, has made ESI-MS a method of choice for the characterization of macromolecules. This paper describes the application of MS to study large non-covalent complexes. We categorize the available techniques in two groups. First, solution-based techniques in which the biomolecules are labeled in solution and subsequently characterized by MS. Three MS-based techniques are discussed, namely hydroxyl radical footprinting, cross-linking and hydrogen/deuterium exchange (HDX) MS. In the second group, MS-based techniques to probe intact biomolecules in the gas-phase, e.g. side-chain microsolvation, HDX and ion mobility spectrometry are discussed. Together, the approaches place MS as a powerful methodology for an ever growing plethora of structural applications.},

   abstract = {Mincle, the macrophage-inducible C-type lectin also known as CLEC-4E, binds to the mycobacterial glycolipid trehalose dimycolate and initiates a signaling cascade by serving as a receptor for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other pathogenic mycobacterial species. Studies of the biological functions of human mincle often rely on mouse models, based on the assumption that the biological properties of the mouse receptor mimic those of the human protein. Experimental support for this assumption has been obtained by expression of the carbohydrate-recognition domain of mouse mincle and characterization of its interaction with small molecule analogs of trehalose dimycolate. The results confirm that the ligand-binding properties of mouse mincle closely parallel those of the human receptor. These findings are consistent with the conservation of key amino acid residues that have been shown to form the ligand-binding site in human and cow mincle. Sequence alignment reveals that these residues are conserved in a wide range of mammalian species, suggesting that mincle has a conserved function in binding ligands that may include endogenous mammalian glycans or pathogen glycans in addition to trehalose dimycolate. © 2015 by the authors; licensee MDPI.},

Identifying hundreds of proteins from rather simple biological matrices, such as yeast, was a daunting task just a few decades ago. Now, expression of more than half of the estimated approximately 20,000 human protein coding genes can be confirmed in record time and from minute sample quantities. Access to proteomic information at such unprecedented depths has been fueled by strides in every stage of the shotgun proteomics workflow-from sample processing to data analysis-and promises to revolutionize our understanding of the causes and consequences of proteome variation.},

   abstract = {Marine bioactive metabolites are often heterogeneously expressed in tissues both spatially and over time. Therefore, traditional solvent extraction methods benefit from an understanding of the in situ sites of biosynthesis and storage to deal with heterogeneity and maximize yield. Recently, surface-assisted mass spectrometry (MS) methods namely nanostructure-assisted laser desorption ionisation (NALDI) and desorption ionisation on porous silicon (DIOS) surfaces have been developed to enable the direct detection of low molecular weight metabolites. Since direct tissue NALDI-MS or DIOS-MS produce complex spectra due to the wide variety of other metabolites and fragments present in the low mass range, we report here the use of “on surface” solvent separation directly from mollusc tissue onto nanostructured surfaces for MS analysis, as a mechanism for simplifying data annotation and detecting possible artefacts from compound delocalization during the preparative steps. Water, ethanol, chloroform and hexane selectively extracted a range of choline esters, brominated indoles and lipids from Dicathais orbita hypobranchial tissue imprints. These compounds could be quantified on the nanostructured surfaces by comparison to standard curves generated from the pure compounds. Surface-assisted MS could have broad utility for detecting a broad range of secondary metabolites in complex marine tissue samples.},

One such example is the association between choline esters and Tyrian purple precursors in muricid molluscs. Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) on nano-structured surfaces has emerged as a sophisticated platform for spatial analysis of low molecular mass metabolites in heterogeneous tissues, ideal for low abundant secondary metabolites. Here we applied desorption-ionisation on porous silicon (DIOS) to examine in situ changes in biodistribution over the reproductive cycle. DIOS-MSI showed muscle-relaxing choline ester murexine to co-localise with tyrindoxyl sulfate in the biosynthetic hypobranchial glands. But during egg-laying, murexine was transferred to the capsule gland, and then to the egg capsules, where chemical ripening resulted in Tyrian purple formation. Murexine was found to tranquilise the larvae and may relax the reproductive tract. This study shows that DIOS-MSI is a powerful tool that can provide new insights into marine chemo-ecology.},

   abstract = {Calculation of cleavage entropies allows to quantify, map and compare protease substrate specificity by an information entropy based approach. The metric intrinsically depends on the number of experimentally determined substrates (data points). Thus a statistical analysis of its numerical stability is crucial to estimate the systematic error made by estimating specificity based on a limited number of substrates. In this contribution, we show the mathematical basis for estimating the uncertainty in cleavage entropies. Sets of cleavage entropies are calculated using experimental cleavage data and modeled extreme cases. By analyzing the underlying mathematics and applying statistical tools, a linear dependence of the metric in respect to 1/n was found. This allows us to extrapolate the values to an infinite number of samples and to estimate the errors. Analyzing the errors, a minimum number of 30 substrates was found to be necessary to characterize substrate specificity, in terms of amino acid variability, for a protease (S4-S4’) with an uncertainty of 5 percent. Therefore, we encourage experimental researchers in the protease field to record specificity profiles of novel proteases aiming to identify at least 30 peptide substrates of maximum sequence diversity. We expect a full characterization of protease specificity helpful to rationalize biological functions of proteases and to assist rational drug design.},

Cell type-specific proteins defined as tenfold more abundant than average expression represented about a tenth of the proteome, with an overrepresentation of cell surface proteins. To demonstrate the utility of our resource, we focused on this class of proteins and identified Lsamp, an adhesion molecule of the IgLON family, as a negative regulator of myelination.

   abstract = {Resolving the molecular details of proteome variation in the different tissues and organs of the human body will greatly increase our knowledge of human biology and disease. Here, we present a map of the human tissue proteome based on an integrated omics approach that involves quantitative transcriptomics at the tissue and organ level, combined with tissue microarray-based immunohistochemistry, to achieve spatial localization of proteins down to the single-cell level. Our tissue-based analysis detected more than 90% of the putative protein-coding genes. We used this approach to explore the human secretome, the membrane proteome, the druggable proteome, the cancer proteome, and the metabolic functions in 32 different tissues and organs. All the data are integrated in an interactive Web-based database that allows exploration of individual proteins, as well as navigation of global expression patterns, in all major tissues and organs in the human body.},

   abstract = {Philodryas chamissonis is a rear-fanged snake endemic to Chile. Its bite produces mild to moderate symptoms with proteolytic and anti-coagulant effects. Presently, the composition of the venom, as well as, the biochemical and structural characteristics of its toxins, remains unknown. In this study, we cloned and reported the first full-length sequences of five toxin-encoding genes from the venom gland of this species: Type III snake venom metalloprotease (SVMP), snake venom serine protease (SVSP), Cysteine-rich secretory protein (CRISP), α and β subunits of C-type lectin-like protein (CLP) and C-type natriuretic peptide (NP). These genes are highly expressed in the venom gland and their sequences exhibited a putative signal peptide, suggesting that these are components of the venom. These putative toxins had different evolutionary relationships with those reported for some front-fanged snakes, being SVMP, SVSP and CRISP of P. chamissonis closely related to the toxins present in Elapidae species, while NP was more related to those of Viperidae species. In addition, analyses suggest that the α and β subunits of CLP of P. chamissonis might have a α-subunit scaffold in common with Viperidae species, whose highly variable C-terminal region might have allowed the diversification in α and β subunits. Our results provide the first molecular description of the toxins possibly implicated in the envenomation of prey and humans by the bite of P. chamissonis. © 2015 Elsevier Ltd.},

   abstract = {AbstractAims Saxagliptin is a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitor that was approved in Japan for the treatment of type 2 diabetes in 2013. We examined its efficacy and safety in Japanese hemodialysis patients with diabetic nephropathy. Methods In this prospective, open-label, parallel-group study, Japanese hemodialysis patients were randomized to receive either oral saxagliptin (2.5 mg/day) or usual care (control group) for 24 weeks. Before randomization, patients received fixed doses of conventional antidiabetic drugs (oral drugs and/or insulin) for 8 weeks; these drugs were continued during the study. Endpoints included changes in glycated albumin (GA), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), postprandial plasma glucose (PPG), and adverse events. Results Both groups included 41 patients. Mean GA, HbA1c, and PPG decreased significantly in the saxagliptin group (−3.4%, −0.6% [−7 mmol/mol], and −38.3 mg/dL, respectively; all P < 0.0001) but not in the control group (0%, −0.1% [−1 mmol/mol], and −3.7 mg/dL, respectively) (P < 0.0001, P < 0.001, and P < 0.0001, respectively). In saxagliptin-treated patients, the reduction in GA was significantly greater when saxagliptin was administered as monotherapy than in combination therapy (−4.2% vs. −3.0%, P = 0.012) despite similar baseline values (24.5% vs. 23.3%). Reductions in GA, HbA1c, and PPG were greater in patients whose baseline values exceeded the median (23.8% for GA, 6.6% for HbA1c, and 180 mg/dL for PPG). There were no adverse events associated with saxagliptin. Conclusions Saxagliptin (2.5 mg/day) was effective and well tolerated when used as monotherapy or combined with other antidiabetic drugs in Japanese hemodialysis patients with type 2 diabetes.

   abstract = {Background: Mouse has been extensively used as a tool for investigating the onset and development of human neurological disorders. As a first step to construct a transgenic mouse model of human brain lesions, it is of fundamental importance to clarify the similarity and divergence of genetic background between non-diseased human and mouse brain tissues. Methods: We systematically compared, based on large scale integrated microarray data, the transcriptomes of three anatomically distinct brain regions; prefrontal cortex (PFC), hippocampus (HIP) and striatum (STR), across human and mouse. The widely used DAVID web server was used to decipher the biological functions of the highly expressed genes that were identified using a previously reported approach. Venn analysis was used to depict the overlapping ratios of the notably enriched biological process (BP) terms (one-tailed Fisher's exact test and Benjamini correction; adjusted p < 0.01) between two brain tissues. GOSem- Sim, an R package, was selected to perform GO semantic similarity analysis. Next, we adjusted signal intensities of orthologous genes by the total signals in all samples within species, and used one minus Pearson's correlation coefficient to assess the expression distance. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) were selected for expression pattern analysis. Lineage specific expressed orthologous genes were identified by comparison of the most extreme sub-datasets across species and further verified using reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). Results: We found that the number of the significantly enriched BP terms of the highly expressed genes in human brain regions is larger than that in mouse corresponding brain regions. The mainly involved BP terms in human brain tissues associated with protein-membrane targeting and selenium metabolism are species-specific. The overlapping ratios of all the significantly enriched BP terms between any two brain tissues across species are lower than that within species, but the pairwise semantic similarities are very high between any two brain tissues from either human or mouse. Hierarchical clustering analysis shows the biological functions of the highly expressed genes in brain tissues are more consistent within species than interspecies; whereas it shows the expression patterns of orthologous genes are evidently conserved between human and mouse equivalent brain tissues. In addition, we identified four orthologous genes (COX5B, WIF1, SLC4A10 and PLA2G7) that are speciesspecific, which have been widely studied and confirmed to be closely linked with neurophysiological and pathological functions. Conclusion: Our study highlights the similarities and divergences in gene function and expression between human and mouse corresponding brain regions, including PFC, HIP and STR. © 2016 Chen et al.

   abstract = {Peptides function as signaling molecules in species as diverse as humans and yeast. Mass spectrometry-based peptidomics techniques provide a relatively unbiased method to assess the peptidome of biological samples. In the present study, we used a quantitative peptidomic technique to characterize the peptidome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and compare it to the peptidomes of mammalian cell lines and tissues. Altogether, 297 yeast peptides derived from 75 proteins were identified. The yeast peptides are similar to those of the human peptidome in average size and amino acid composition. Inhibition of proteasome activity with either bortezomib or epoxomicin led to decreased levels of some yeast peptides, suggesting that these peptides are generated by the proteasome. Approximately 30% of the yeast peptides correspond to the N- or C-terminus of the protein; the human peptidome is also highly represented in N- or C-terminal protein fragments. Most yeast and humans peptides are derived from a subset of abundant proteins, many with functions involving cellular metabolism or protein synthesis and folding. Of the 75 yeast proteins that give rise to peptides, 24 have orthologs that give rise to human and/or mouse peptides and for some, the same region of the proteins are found in the human, mouse, and yeast peptidomes. Taken together, these results support the hypothesis that intracellular peptides may have specific and conserved biological functions. © 2016 Dasgupta et al.

   abstract = {Down syndrome (DS), trisomy of human chromosome 21 (Hsa21), is challenging to model in mice. Not only is it a contiguous gene syndrome spanning 35 Mb of the long arm of Hsa21, but orthologs of Hsa21 genes map to segments of three mouse chromosomes, Mmu16, Mmu17, and Mmu10. The Ts65Dn was the first viable segmental trisomy mouse model for DS; it is a partial trisomy currently popular in preclinical evaluations of drugs for cognition in DS. Limitations of the Ts65Dn are as follows: (i) it is trisomic for 125 human protein-coding orthologs, but only 90 of these are Hsa21 orthologs and (ii) it lacks trisomy for ~75 Hsa21 orthologs. In recent years, several additional mouse models of DS have been generated, each trisomic for a different subset of Hsa21 genes or their orthologs. To best exploit these models and interpret the results obtained with them, prior to proposing clinical trials, an understanding of their trisomic gene content, relative to full trisomy 21, is necessary. Here we first review the functional information on Hsa21 protein-coding genes and the more recent annotation of a large number of functional RNA genes. We then discuss the conservation and genomic distribution of Hsa21 orthologs in the mouse genome and the distribution of mouse-specific genes. Lastly, we consider the strengths and weaknesses of mouse models of DS based on the number and nature of the Hsa21 orthologs that are, and are not, trisomic in each, and discuss their validity for use in preclinical evaluations of drug responses. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

IID covers six species (S. cerevisiae (yeast), C. elegans(worm), D. melonogaster(fly), R. norvegicus (rat), M. musculus(mouse) and H. sapiens(human)) and up to 30 tissues per species. Users query IID by providing a set of proteins or PPIs from any of these organisms, and specifying species and tissues where IID should search for interactions. If query proteins are not from the selected species, IID enables searches across species and tissues automatically by using their orthologs; for example, retrieving interactions in a given tissue, conserved in human and mouse. Interaction data in IID comprises three types of PPI networks: experimentally detected PPIs from major databases, orthologous PPIs and highconfidence computationally predicted PPIs. Interactions are assigned to tissues where their proteins pairs or encoding genes are expressed. IID is a major replacement of the I2D interaction database, with larger PPI networks (a total of 1,566,043 PPIs among 68,831 proteins), tissue annotations for interactions, and new query, analysis and data visualization capabilities.

Depending on the physiological state and sample origin, collected samples are used in research and diagnostics for different purposes. In mass spectrometry-based proteomics, body fluids and tissues are commonly used in discovery experiments to search for specific protein markers that can distinguish physiological from pathophysiological states, which in turn offer new diagnosis strategies and help developing new drugs to prevent disease more efficiently.

   abstract = {Human ageing is the gradual decline in organ and tissue function with increasing chronological time, leading eventually to loss of function and death. To study the processes involved over research-relevant timescales requires the use of accessible model systems that share significant similarities with humans. In this review, we assess the usefulness of various models, including unicellular yeasts, invertebrate worms and flies, mice and primates including humans, and highlight the benefits and possible drawbacks of each model system in its ability to illuminate human ageing mechanisms. We describe the strong evolutionary conservation of molecular pathways that govern cell responses to extracellular and intracellular signals and which are strongly implicated in ageing. Such pathways centre around insulin-like growth factor signalling and integration of stress and nutritional signals through mTOR kinase. The process of cellular senescence is evaluated as a possible underlying cause for many of the frailties and diseases of human ageing. Also considered is ageing arising from systemic changes that cannot be modelled in lower organisms and instead require studies either in small mammals or in primates. We also touch briefly on novel therapeutic options arising from a better understanding of the biology of ageing. © 2016},

   abstract = {Protein expression level is one of the strongest predictors of protein sequence evolutionary rate, with high-expression protein sequences evolving at slower rates than low-expression protein sequences largely because of constraints on protein folding and function. Expression evolutionary rates also have been shown to be negatively correlated with expression level across human and mouse orthologs over relatively long divergence times (i.e., ~100 million years). Long-term evolutionary patterns, however, often cannot be extrapolated to microevolutionary processes (and vice versa), and whether this relationship holds for traits evolving under directional selection within a single species over ecological timescales (i.e., <5000 years) is unknown and not necessarily expected. Expression is a metabolically costly process, and the expression level of a particular protein is predicted to be a tradeoff between the benefit of its function and the costs of its expression. Selection should drive the expression level of all proteins close to values that maximize fitness, particularly for high-expression proteins because of the increased energetic cost of production. Therefore, stabilizing selection may reduce the amount of standing expression variation for high-expression proteins, and in combination with physiological constraints that may place an upper bound on the range of beneficial expression variation, these constraints could severely limit the availability of beneficial expression variants. To determine whether rapid-expression evolution was restricted to low-expression proteins owing to these constraints on highly expressed proteins over ecological timescales, we compared venom protein expression levels across mainland and island populations for three species of pit vipers. We detected significant differentiation in protein expression levels in two of the three species and found that rapid-expression differentiation was restricted to low-expression proteins. Our results suggest that various constraints on high-expression proteins reduce the availability of beneficial expression variants relative to lowexpression proteins, enabling low-expression proteins to evolve and potentially lead to more rapid adaptation. © 2016 by the Genetics Society of America.},

   abstract = {Background: Solute carriers (SLCs) are membrane bound transporters responsible for the movement of soluble molecules such as amino acids, ions, nucleotides, neurotransmitters and oligopeptides over cellular membranes. At present, there are 395 SLCs identified in humans, where about 40% are still uncharacterized with unknown expression and/or function(s). Here we have studied two uncharacterized atypical SLCs that belong to the Major Facilitator Superfamily Pfam clan, Major facilitator superfamily domain 5 (MFSD5) and Major facilitator superfamily domain 11 (MFSD11). We provide fundamental information about the histology in mice as well as data supporting their disposition to regulate expression levels to keep the energy homeostasis. Results: In mice subjected to starvation or high-fat diet, the mRNA expression of Mfsd5 was significantly down-regulated (P<0.001) in food regulatory brain areas whereas Mfsd11 was significantly up-regulated in mice subjected to either starvation (P<0.01) or high-fat diet (P<0.001). qRT-PCR analysis on wild type tissues demonstrated that both Mfsd5 and Mfsd11 have a wide central and peripheral mRNA distribution, and immunohistochemistry was utilized to display the abundant protein expression in the mouse embryo and the adult mouse brain. Both proteins are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory neurons, but not in astrocytes. Conclusions: Mfsd5 and Mfsd11 are both affected by altered energy homeostasis, suggesting plausible involvement in the energy regulation. Moreover, the first histological mapping of MFSD5 and MFSD11 shows ubiquitous expression in the periphery and the central nervous system of mice, where the proteins are expressed in excitatory and inhibitory mouse brain neurons. © 2016 Perland et al.

   abstract = {The prevalence of diabetes mellitus, which currently affects 387 million people worldwide, is permanently rising in both adults and adolescents. Despite numerous treatment options, diabetes mellitus is a progressive disease with severe comorbidities, such as nephropathy, neuropathy, and retinopathy, as well as cardiovascular disease. Therefore, animal models predictive of the efficacy and safety of novel compounds in humans are of great value to address the unmet need for improved therapeutics. Although rodent models provide important mechanistic insights, their predictive value for therapeutic outcomes in humans is limited. In recent years, the pig has gained importance for biomedical research because of its close similarity to human anatomy, physiology, size, and, in contrast to non-human primates, better ethical acceptance. In this review, anatomic, biochemical, physiological, and morphologic aspects relevant to diabetes research will be compared between different animal species, that is, mouse, rat, rabbit, pig, and non-human primates. The value of the pig as a model organism for diabetes research will be highlighted, and (dis)advantages of the currently available approaches for the generation of pig models exhibiting characteristics of metabolic syndrome or type 2 diabetes mellitus will be discussed. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.},

   abstract = {There are five major classes of glycan including N- and O-glycans, glycosaminoglycans, glycosphingolipids, and glycophosphatidylinositol anchors, all expressed at the molecular frontier of each mammalian cell. Numerous biological consequences of altering the expression of mammalian glycans are understood at a mechanistic level, but many more remain to be characterized. Mouse mutants with deleted, defective, or misexpressed genes that encode activities necessary for glycosylation have led the way to identifying key functions of glycans in biology. However, with the advent of exome sequencing, humans with mutations in genes involved in glycosylation are also revealing specific requirements for glycans in mammalian development. The aim of this review is to summarize glycosylation genes that are necessary for mouse embryonic development, pathway-specific glycosylation genes whose deletion leads to postnatal morbidity, and glycosylation genes for which effects are mild, but perturbation of the organism may reveal functional consequences. General strategies for generating and interpreting the phenotype of mice with glycosylation defects are discussed in relation to human congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG). © 2016 Elsevier Ltd},

   abstract = {The human cardiovascular system is a complex arrangement of specialized structures with distinct functions. The molecular landscape, including the genome, transcriptome and proteome, is pivotal to the biological complexity of both normal and abnormal mammalian processes. Despite our advancing knowledge and understanding of cardiovascular disease (CVD) through the principal use of rodent models, this continues to be an increasing issue in today's world. For instance, as the ageing population increases, so does the incidence of heart valve dysfunction. This may be because of changes in molecular composition and structure of the extracellular matrix, or from the pathological process of vascular calcification in which bone-formation related factors cause ectopic mineralization. However, significant differences between mice and men exist in terms of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology and pathology. In contrast, large animal models can show considerably greater similarity to humans. Furthermore, precise and efficient genome editing techniques enable the generation of tailored models for translational research. These novel systems provide a huge potential for large animal models to investigate the regulatory factors and molecular pathways that contribute to CVD in vivo. In turn, this will help bridge the gap between basic science and clinical applications by facilitating the refinement of therapies for cardiovascular disease. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

Perseus contains a comprehensive portfolio of statistical tools for high-dimensional omics data analysis covering normalization, pattern recognition, time-series analysis, cross-omics comparisons and multiple-hypothesis testing. A machine learning module supports the classification and validation of patient groups for diagnosis and prognosis, and it also detects predictive protein signatures. Central to Perseus is a user-friendly, interactive workflow environment that provides complete documentation of computational methods used in a publication. All activities in Perseus are realized as plugins, and users can extend the software by programming their own, which can be shared through a plugin store. We anticipate that Perseus's arsenal of algorithms and its intuitive usability will empower interdisciplinary analysis of complex large data sets.},

   abstract = {Proteolysis is a major form of post translational modification which occurs when a protease cleaves peptide bonds in a target protein to modify its activity. Tracking protease substrates is indispensable for understanding its cellular functions. However, it is difficult to directly identify protease substrates because the end products of proteolysis, the cleaved protein fragments, must be identified among the pool of cellular proteins. Here we present a bead-based cleavage approach using immobilized proteome as the screening library to identify protease substrates. This method enables efficient separation of proteolyzed proteins from background protein mixture. Using caspase-3 as the model protease, we have identified 1159 high confident substrates, among which, strikingly, 43.9% of substrates undergo degradation during apoptosis. The huge number of substrates and positive support of in vivo evidence indicate that the BBC method is a powerful tool for protease substrates identification.},

   journal = {Neuropharmacology},
   volume = {105},
   pages = {215-227},
   abstract = {Opioids acting at the mu opioid receptor (MOR) are the most effective analgesics, however adverse side effects severely limit their use. Of particular importance, abuse liability results in major medical, societal, and economic problems, respiratory depression is the cause of fatal overdoses, and tolerance complicates treatment and increases the risk of side effects. Motor and cognitive impairment are especially problematic for older adults. Despite the host of negative side effects, opioids such as morphine are commonly used for acute and chronic pain conditions. Separation of analgesia from unwanted effects has long been an unmet goal of opioid research. Novel MOR agonist structures may prove critical for greater success. Here we tested metabolically stable analogs of the endomorphins, endogenous opioids highly selective for the MOR. Compared to morphine, the analogs showed dramatically improved analgesia-to-side-effect ratios. At doses providing equal or greater antinociception than morphine in the rat, the analogs showed reduced a) respiratory depression, b) impairment of motor coordination, c) tolerance and hyperalgesia, d) glial p38/CGRP/P2X7 receptor signaling, and e) reward/abuse potential in both conditioned place preference and self-administration tests. Differential effects on glial activation indicate a mechanism for the relative lack of side effects by the analogs compared to morphine. The results suggest that endomorphin analogs described here could provide gold standard pain relief mediated by selective MOR activation, but with remarkably safer side effect profiles compared to opioids like morphine.},
